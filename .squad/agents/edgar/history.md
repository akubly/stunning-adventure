# Edgar — History

**Role:** Learning Systems Specialist (Plasticity, trust, recency, recall algorithms)
**Status:** Path D locked. Eureka kernel-shaped design extraction-ready. Cycle 2 combo pass complete (F6 + C5 + C6).
**Last update:** 2026-05-29

**Key milestones:**
- R5-R6: Power-law recency + event-driven trust design
- R7-R8: v5-final locked canonical (extraction-ready mechanisms verified)
- M2-M3: recall() + composite-ranker landed (§30 §1.2 FR-2 formula inline)
- Cycle 2 fixes: F6 minTrust interface, C5 Ranker JSDoc, C6 guard test
- Build: 609 Cairn, 644 Forge, 9 Eureka tests green

**Scribe note (2026-05-29T23:24:24Z):** Review cycle 2 complete. All findings processed. M5 unblocked. See decisions.md for Cycle 2 resolutions.

## Learnings

**2026-05-29 — PR #30 Copilot cloud review (T2/T3/T4)**

- **camelCase-at-activity-layer norm:** Activity-layer types (`RecallResult`, `ScoredResult`) use camelCase (`attentionTier`, `lastAccessed`). The FactStore storage seam is responsible for snake↔camel mapping at the data boundary. Snake_case fields in TypeScript activity types were a smell — they belonged one layer down.

- **Ranker BM25-truncation constraint documented:** A custom `Ranker` injected into `recall.ts` only sees at most `k` candidates pre-filtered by BM25 in FactStore.search(). It cannot surface candidates at positions k+1..k+m. This is now documented on the `Ranker` JSDoc. If a future ranker needs broader visibility, overfetching (`limit: k * overfetchFactor`) is the remedy — tracked as future work.

- **Fragile-doc-cite anti-pattern:** Embedding external document line-number claims in production source (e.g., "§50 line 211 contains incorrect values") is fragile — the doc will be edited, the line will shift, the comment becomes misleading. The correct approach: cite only the authoritative source (§30 §1.2) and track the discrepancy in decisions.md, not in source code.

**2026-05-29 — PR #30 Copilot cloud review (Cycle 2, runtime attentionTier guard)**

- **Compile-time strictness + runtime defensiveness are complementary, not contradictory:** TypeScript union narrowing (no `?? 1.00` fallback) catches typos at compile time. A runtime guard (`multiplier === undefined → warn + default 1.0`) defends against SQLite rows that bypass TS narrowing. Both belong — they operate at different seams.

- **Stderr-warn discipline for MCP compatibility:** Any console diagnostic emitted inside recall.ts must go to `console.warn` (stderr), never `console.log` (stdout). The MCP transport uses stdout for protocol messages; any stdout noise corrupts the JSON-RPC frame. This is an invariant for all eureka activity code.


📌 Team update (2026-05-30T12:26:16Z): **WI-B (PR #29) shipped** — Coordinator worktree dispatch now real; use SQUAD_WORKTREES=1 to activate. Cycles: 8→5→8→51→19→9→0 threads. Recovery: cycle-3 incident (direct push ae62558 reverted 3086c68) taught worktree armor pattern; Graham's prose redesign (cycle 4) resolved F8/F9/F10; final state: zero unresolved threads, clean main. Follow-ups: fallback warning (issue filed), #25 polish. — Scribe
- **NaN-guard pattern (generalised):** The F1 guard (clamp negative tDays) and F7 guard (default undefined multiplier) follow the same structural pattern: identify the input path that produces `NaN`, add a narrowing check, emit a diagnostic on the unexpected branch, substitute a safe default. Apply this pattern to any numeric pipeline that crosses a runtime seam.
