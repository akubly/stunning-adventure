📌 Team update (2026-05-22T14:07:59Z): **Phase 4.6 Wave 2 complete** — ChangeVectorProvider + ForgePrescriberOrchestrator + autoApplyEligible safety gate + hint dedup + forge-prescribe CLI all shipped. 1199 tests passing, 9 work items landed, 4 decisions merged. Wave 3 (Curator-driven orchestration + composition root) deferred behind ADR. — Scribe
📌 Team update (2026-05-22T20:35:00Z): **Wave 2 W2-5 complete** — ForgePrescriberOrchestrator shipped. Attenuation + autoApplyEligible propagation live. ATTENUATION_FLOOR=0.1 exported from @akubly/types. Fail-open on provider errors. Forge tests 609 passing (+10), root build green. — Scribe
📌 Team update (2026-05-22T20:03:56Z): Wave 2 v3.1 scope final — autoApplyEligible propagates through OptimizationHint; constants NEGATIVE_IMPACT_AUTO_APPLY_GATE=-0.2 and ATTENUATION_FLOOR=0.1; CLI surface only — no MCP in Wave 2. — Graham Knight

## 2026-05-21: Wave 2 v3 Scope Ready — Curator Wiring Deferred to Wave 3

Scribe orchestration complete: Graham's v3 scope finalized. Key scope decisions:
- ChangeVectorProvider port with async return type for Phase 5 cloud readiness
- Wave 2/3 split: Manual invocation in Wave 2; Curator-driven automatic orchestration deferred to Wave 3
- Hint deduplication via (skillId, source, category) key with active-status filter
- Two-layer negative-impact attenuation: Confidence scaling + eligibility flag (autoApplyEligible)

## Learnings — Wave 2 W2-3/W2-7 SqliteChangeVectorProvider (2026-05-22)

- getAllCategories(db, skillId) lives in packages/cairn/src/db/changeVectors.ts. Reads distinct values from optimization_hints.category column for a given skill_id.
- SqliteChangeVectorProvider now lives in packages/cairn/src/db/sqliteChangeVectorProvider.ts and is exported from Cairn's top-level src/index.ts barrel.
- Type reconciliation at DB boundary: getAllCategories() filters raw SQLite category strings through canonical OptimizationCategory union from @akubly/types.
- SqliteChangeVectorProvider.getSummaries() deliberately drops zero-vector summaries to keep downstream orchestration in Phase 4.5 fallback mode.
- Verification: npm run build, npm test --workspace=@akubly/cairn, and root npm test all passed. Cairn 564 passing tests; Forge 599 passing.
- Wave 2 W2-8 applier gate lives in packages/forge/src/applier/optimizer.ts inside applyOptimizations(), before the confidence threshold check. It skips with reason `negative-impact-vector-history` when autoApplyEligible resolves to false.
- The applier resolves autoApplyEligible from the hint's top-level field first, then falls back to hint.evidence.autoApplyEligible for persisted Cairn rows. Missing/undefined still means eligible for backward compatibility.
- Cairn hint dedup now lives in packages/cairn/src/db/optimizationHints.ts via `insertHintIfNew(db, hint): { inserted: boolean; existingHintId?: string }`, and insertOptimizationHint() now routes through that helper.
- Active dedup statuses for optimization hints are pending, accepted, and deferred; terminal states (applied, rejected, expired, suppressed, failed) do not block reinsertion of the same (skillId, source, category) tuple.

### Wave 3 Shipped (2026-05-23 ~21:08Z)

PR #21 merged as f27a537 on main. 1219 tests passing. 7 work items delivered end-to-end: composition root R2 (`@akubly/skillsmith-runtime`), Curator hook wiring, per-skill orchestration, E2E tests, Phase 5-ready acyclic boundaries. 14 Copilot findings addressed across 4 review cycles. 1 deferral approved: insertHintIfNew atomicity (partial UNIQUE + BEGIN IMMEDIATE) → Wave 4.
