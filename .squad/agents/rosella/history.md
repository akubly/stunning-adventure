📌 Team update (2026-05-22T20:35:00Z): **Wave 2 W2-5 complete** — ForgePrescriberOrchestrator shipped. Attenuation + autoApplyEligible propagation live. ATTENUATION_FLOOR=0.1 exported from @akubly/types. Fail-open on provider errors. Forge tests 609 passing (+10), root build green. — Scribe
📌 Team update (2026-05-22T20:03:56Z): Wave 2 v3.1 scope final — autoApplyEligible propagates through OptimizationHint; constants NEGATIVE_IMPACT_AUTO_APPLY_GATE=-0.2 and ATTENUATION_FLOOR=0.1; CLI surface only — no MCP in Wave 2. — Graham Knight

## 2026-05-21: Wave 2 v3 Scope Ready — Curator Wiring Deferred to Wave 3

Scribe orchestration complete: Graham's v3 scope finalized. Key scope decisions:
- ChangeVectorProvider port with async return type for Phase 5 cloud readiness
- Wave 2/3 split: Manual invocation in Wave 2; Curator-driven automatic orchestration deferred to Wave 3
- Hint deduplication via (skillId, source, category) key with active-status filter
- Two-layer negative-impact attenuation: Confidence scaling + eligibility flag (autoApplyEligible)

## Learnings — Wave 2 W2-3/W2-7 SqliteChangeVectorProvider (2026-05-22)

- getAllCategories(db, skillId) lives in packages/cairn/src/db/changeVectors.ts. Reads distinct values from optimization_hints.category column for a given skill_id.
- SqliteChangeVectorProvider now lives in packages/cairn/src/db/sqliteChangeVectorProvider.ts and is exported from Cairn's top-level src/index.ts barrel.
- Type reconciliation at DB boundary: getAllCategories() filters raw SQLite category strings through canonical OptimizationCategory union from @akubly/types.
- SqliteChangeVectorProvider.getSummaries() deliberately drops zero-vector summaries to keep downstream orchestration in Phase 4.5 fallback mode.
- Verification: npm run build, npm test --workspace=@akubly/cairn, and root npm test all passed. Cairn 564 passing tests; Forge 599 passing.
