📌 Team update (2026-05-22T14:07:59Z): **Phase 4.6 Wave 2 complete** — ChangeVectorProvider + ForgePrescriberOrchestrator + autoApplyEligible safety gate + hint dedup + forge-prescribe CLI all shipped. 1199 tests passing, 9 work items landed, 4 decisions merged. Wave 3 (Curator-driven orchestration + composition root) deferred behind ADR. — Scribe
📌 Team update (2026-05-22T20:35:00Z): **Wave 2 W2-5 complete** — ForgePrescriberOrchestrator shipped. Attenuation + autoApplyEligible propagation live. ATTENUATION_FLOOR=0.1 exported from @akubly/types. Fail-open on provider errors. Forge tests 609 passing (+10), root build green. — Scribe
📌 Team update (2026-05-22T20:03:56Z): Wave 2 v3.1 scope final — autoApplyEligible propagates through OptimizationHint; constants NEGATIVE_IMPACT_AUTO_APPLY_GATE=-0.2 and ATTENUATION_FLOOR=0.1; CLI surface only — no MCP in Wave 2. — Graham Knight

## 2026-05-21: Wave 2 v3 Scope Ready — Curator Wiring Deferred to Wave 3

Scribe orchestration complete: Graham's v3 scope finalized and merged to .squad/decisions.md. Key scope decisions:
- ChangeVectorProvider port with async return type for Phase 5 cloud readiness
- Wave 2/3 split: Manual invocation in Wave 2; Curator-driven automatic orchestration deferred to Wave 3
- Hint deduplication via (skillId, source, category) key with active-status filter
- Two-layer negative-impact attenuation: Confidence scaling + eligibility flag (autoApplyEligible)

Ready for Wave 2 implementation (computation + ranking only; runtime wiring follows in Wave 3).

## Learnings (2026-05-22 — Wave 2 W2-9 manual CLI surface)

- Wave 2's explicit composition root now lives in `packages/runtime-cli/` with bin name `forge-prescribe`; it's the one package allowed to import both `@akubly/cairn` and `@akubly/forge` without violating the package boundary.
- Local invocation pattern from the repo root is `npx forge-prescribe --skill <id> [--db <path>]`; the root workspace keeps `@akubly/runtime-cli` as a dev dependency so the bin is linked into the local toolchain after `npm install`.
- Profile loading is deterministic: try the canonical per-skill aggregate first (`granularity='per-skill', granularity_key='global'`), then fall back to a skill-scoped `global/global` profile before failing with a clean no-profile result.
- Exit semantics are simple: 0 on successful orchestration (including zero generated hints or dedup skips), 1 when no execution profile exists, and 2 for argument, database, or persistence failures.

## Learnings (2026-05-22 — Wave 2 W2-1 shared change-vector contract)

- Canonical Wave 2 change-vector contracts now live in packages/types/src/index.ts: ChangeVectorSummary, ChangeVectorProvider, NEGATIVE_IMPACT_AUTO_APPLY_GATE, and shared OptimizationCategory.
- Reconciled the two ChangeVectorSummary duplicates by taking Forge's stricter OptimizationCategory union instead of Cairn's plain string. Added autoApplyEligible?: boolean as the additive v3.1 field on the shared contract.
- Verification: root npm run build and root npm test passed before and after the change (1153-test baseline green).
