# Graham — History

**Role:** Lead / Architect (Overall vision, cross-system integration, tiebreak arbitration)
**Status:** M5+M6 branch prep complete. Feature branch `eureka/m5-m6-trust-feedback` ready for review-cycle.
**Last update:** 2026-05-30

**Key contributions:**
- Phase 4.6 wave orchestration: 5 waves integrated (0-6)
- Brain system: ADR-pending (Curator-driven orchestration, composition root)
- Eureka C8: Recommended exemption for integration test validation (conservative layering concern)
- Resolution: Aaron sided with Genesta; strict eslint enforced; §40 documentation compensates

**See history-archive.md for detailed entries.**

**Scribe note (2026-05-29T23:24:24Z):** Review cycle 2 complete. All findings processed. M5 unblocked. See decisions.md for Cycle 2 resolutions.
**Milestone:** R6 opened — Eureka source-reading unlocked; trio (Genesta/Crispin/Edgar) reconciled v3 PRD against Cairn/Forge substrate.

**Key outcomes:**
- Genesta (B+ verdict): PRD v3 stands with v3.1 patch (4 targeted fixes)
- Crispin (Path A recommended): clean-slate Eureka over Cairn extension
- Edgar (Kernel extraction): ~70% mechanical infra exists; recommend shared learning-kernel package

**Your involvement:** Advisory roles on boundaries/UX (2-3 hrs/week contribution rate).

**Decision gates pending Aaron's direction:**
1. Vector search scope (in/out for v1)?
2. Architectural path (A clean-slate or B extension)?
3. Learning-kernel extraction (now or defer)?
4. v3 patch or v4 rewrite?

**Next:** Cassima on deck for v3.1 or v4 intake pending Aaron's architectural direction.

## Learnings

**2026-05-30 — Branch hygiene: rescuing dirty main → feature branch**

Pattern used for M5+M6 branch prep:

1. `git switch -c <feature>` — creates branch from current HEAD (carries Scribe's metadata commit, untracked files, AND tracked working-tree modifications — they stay in the index/working tree, not tied to the branch name)
2. **Critical lesson:** `git switch` carries tracked working-tree modifications with you. If you then `git reset --hard origin/main` on the source branch, those modifications are wiped from disk — not preserved on the feature branch, because they were never committed.
3. **Correct sequence** (learned the hard way): commit implementation on the feature branch BEFORE switching back to main to reset. Or stash before the reset. Never rely on working-tree state surviving a `reset --hard` on a parallel branch.
4. After reset, untracked files survive (gitignore rules aside) because `reset --hard` only touches tracked state.
5. Reconstruction was possible here because the test file (untracked — survived) fully specifies the contract, enabling faithful reimplementation from the test alone.

**Rationale for 2-commit structure vs. 1 monolith:**
- Kept Scribe's metadata commit as-is (don't rewrite what Scribe already landed cleanly)
- Commit A: implementation + tests + spec — single logical RED→GREEN deliverable; reviewers see the complete contract in one diff
- Commit B: team metadata (history, skills) — lower-signal noise that would dilute Commit A's review surface
- Trade-off: 3-commit branch (Scribe + A + B) vs. 2-commit. Accepted — Scribe commit is inert to review-cycle (no code).

**2026-05-30 — gitignore vs `--cached`: untracking committed files + coordinator spawn-prompt error**

Context: PR #34 review (Copilot threads 8, 9, 10) flagged `.squad/orchestration-log/` (34 files), `.squad/log/` (1 file), and `test_results.txt` as committed despite being gitignored.

**Lesson 1 — gitignore does NOT untrack, only blocks new adds.**  
Once a file is committed, `.gitignore` has no effect on it. The only way to untrack it:
```
git rm -r --cached <path>   # removes from index, preserves local files (runtime state safe)
git rm <path>               # removes from index AND from disk (for junk files)
```
Then commit the staged deletions. After the commit, `.gitignore` will prevent re-adds.

**Lesson 2 — Coordinator spawn-prompt error that caused this.**  
My spawn instructions to Scribe listed `orchestration-log/` and `log/` as allowed Scribe-write paths that should be committed. They are gitignored runtime state and must NOT be committed. The correct allowed-paths list for Scribe:
- `decisions.md`, `decisions-archive.md`
- `agents/{name}/history.md`, `agents/{name}/history-archive.md`
- `identity/now.md`

Any other `.squad/` paths (log, orchestration-log, sessions, decisions/inbox/, .scratch/) are runtime state — gitignored, local-only.

**Lesson 3 — `test_results.txt` as tracked artifact.**  
Local test captures with ANSI codes and machine-specific paths (D:/git/...) are never source artifacts. Add to `.gitignore` under `# Local test capture artifacts` and delete from disk.


### 2026-05-29: WI-B Scoping Complete (Recovered from ae62558)

**Event:** Pre-implementation scoping decision made on cycle 4 findings.

**WI-B Scope Confirmation:** Make the coordinator CREATE worktrees per-issue instead of dispatching agents into shared main. Pre-Spawn documentation (lines 697–742) was aspirational; Gabriel to implement.

**Opt-in vs default-on decision:** Option A (Opt-in via SQUAD_WORKTREES=1) recommended for v1. Zero behavior change unless explicitly enabled. Minimal complexity — one if check. Risk is low (worst case: feature unused, status quo maintained).

**Key risk flags codified:**
- File-deletion mystery event: WI-B mitigates via isolation
- 
ode_modules re-install: cleanup flow handles junction removal before git worktree remove
- Pre-Spawn documentation-only: add ACTIVE status + enforcement language
- Parallel dispatch guard: warning-only for v1
- Template drift: atomic updates across all three files

**Status:** Scoping locked. Ready for Gabriel implementation.


📌 Team update (2026-05-30T12:26:16Z): **WI-B (PR #29) shipped** — Coordinator worktree dispatch now real; use SQUAD_WORKTREES=1 to activate. Cycles: 8→5→8→51→19→9→0 threads. Recovery: cycle-3 incident (direct push ae62558 reverted 3086c68) taught worktree armor pattern; Graham's prose redesign (cycle 4) resolved F8/F9/F10; final state: zero unresolved threads, clean main. Follow-ups: fallback warning (issue filed), #25 polish. — Scribe
