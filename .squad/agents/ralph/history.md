## Cross-Team Context: Eureka v1 Design Package Locked (2026-05-28)

**Status:** Eureka v1 design package completed 3-cycle persona review and is now **M1 implementation-ready**.

**What changed:** 19 cycle-1 findings (3 blocking, 11 important, 5 minor) all accepted and landed in cycle 2 fix wave. Cycle 3 cleanup addressed 4 advisories. Design contradictions resolved:
- B1: Scoring formula canonicalized to additive (0.50 relevance + 0.20 importance + 0.20 trust + 0.10 recency)
- B2: Trust/retire semantics: field-level immutability + explicit retirement flag + zombie-fact preservation
- B3: Decision ownership: Forge writes audit (immutable), Eureka writes learning fact (mutable), shared decision_id

**Key fact-correction:** ACT-R exponent corrected 0.7 → 0.5 (caught by Compliance reviewer during cycle 2).

**Deliverables:** PRD v5, TDD Strategy (§55), Technical Design (§00–§50). All documents locked for M1.

**M1 Go/No-Go:** Design ready. Eval set grounded in mem/ repo (M0 deliverable). M1–M5 milestones validated by Pragmatist reviewer.

**For you:** If your work depends on Eureka design decisions, those are now stable. Cross-refs and canonical values are in .squad/decisions.md (Cycle 1 + Cycle 3 sections).

**Commits:** f68873d (cycle 2 fix wave) + 37370f9 (cycle 3 cleanup).

## Team Notifications

Two infrastructure changes approved in PRs #50 and #52:

1. **PR #50 — Root lint cross-platform fix (Issue #37, Gabriel):** Root package.json lint script now uses workspace delegation to enable cross-platform execution. Per-package lint scripts added to 7 packages. Windows developers will now see linting errors locally.

2. **PR #52 — Doc-hygiene back-reference sweep (Issue #46, Gabriel):** Gitignored-path back-references removed from committed prose across decisions.md, decisions-archive.md, and agent history files. Forward writer-targets (charters, templates, skills) preserved. Classification heuristic documented for future hygiene sweeps.

**Action for you:** No immediate action required. Lint workspace changes take effect after merge and 
pm install restart. Doc-hygiene scope established for future improvements.
