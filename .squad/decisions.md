# Squad Decisions

## Active Decisions

### W2-1: ChangeVectorSummary Category Field (Roger)

**Scope:** Type consolidation for shared `ChangeVectorSummary` contract

**Decision:** Use stricter `OptimizationCategory` union (six-value string union from Forge) for `category` field in canonical `@akubly/types` definition.

**Rationale:** Forge already encodes the domain's real category set. Making the union canonical now ensures type safety for W2-2/W2-7 follow-on work while remaining additive (no existing duplicates switched yet).

**Impact:** Both Forge and Cairn gain shared, stricter type contract; future category additions go through Forge's enum.

### W2-7: Category Narrowing at SQLite Boundary (Rosella)

**Scope:** Cairn data layer type safety for ChangeVectorSummary contract

**Decision:** Narrow raw `optimization_hints.category` strings at Cairn's SQLite read boundary instead of widening the shared contract back to `string`.

**Implementation:** `getAllCategories()` filters DB values through the canonical `OptimizationCategory` union from `@akubly/types`. `summarizeChangeVectors()` only accepts narrowed categories. `SqliteChangeVectorProvider.getSummaries()` drops summaries where `vectorCount === 0`.

**Rationale:** DB schema remains permissive for backward compatibility, but cross-package `ChangeVectorSummary` contract is strict. Narrowing once at boundary keeps rest of Cairn aligned with Forge's canonical union without unsafe casts. Zero-vector summaries provide no historical signal and trigger Phase 4.5 fallback mode.

**Impact:** Cairn data layer now type-safe; empty summaries filtered at provider output.

### W2-5: Negative Impact Gate + autoApplyEligible Semantics (Alexander)

**Scope:** Attenuation boundary and hint eligibility signal for negative-impact vectors

**Decision:** Gate boundary is **inclusive** (`<=`) at `-0.2`. Mature negative vectors attenuate and disable auto-apply when `meanNetImpact <= NEGATIVE_IMPACT_AUTO_APPLY_GATE` (value: `-0.2`). A summary at exactly `-0.2` triggers auto-apply disable.

**Rationale:** Safety asymmetry + FP fragility. Inclusive boundary prevents false positives at the exact threshold and provides stronger guard against brittle boundary conditions. Dual-layer testing locks behavior: unit test (alexander-2 maturity-gradient) expects gating at exactly -0.2; E2E canary (laura-1 wave2-pipeline) uses constant directly for drift-proof coverage.

**Implementation:** Gate comparison changed from `<` to `<=` in Forge prescribers and Cairn gate logic. Safety-boundary comment added at comparison site. Maturity-gradient test updated to expect gating at exactly -0.2. E2E pipeline canary uses `NEGATIVE_IMPACT_AUTO_APPLY_GATE` constant directly (prevents configuration drift).

**Impact:** Negative-impact gate boundary now locked by dual-layer testing (unit + E2E); Applier receives explicit attenuation signal for hints at and below threshold; safety margin increased. Decided by Aaron 2026-05-22.

### W2-8: Active Status Set for Optimization Hints (Rosella)

**Scope:** Deduplication logic for `(skillId, source, category)` tuples

**Decision:** Use `pending`, `accepted`, and `deferred` as the active statuses for optimization-hint dedup. Terminal statuses (`applied`, `rejected`, `expired`, `suppressed`, `failed`) do not block reinsertion of same semantic recommendation.

**Rationale:** Active set represents hints still live in operator workflow: waiting to be reviewed, explicitly approved but not yet applied, or intentionally postponed. A second hint during those states duplicates work and pollutes category history. Terminal statuses no longer represent live hints, so they should not block fresh inserts—allows operators to retry after rejection or expiration.

**Implementation:** `packages/cairn/src/db/optimizationHints.ts` encodes `ACTIVE_HINT_STATUSES` constant and uses in both `insertHintIfNew()` and `hasActiveOptimizationHint()`.

**Impact:** Deduplication now enforced at Cairn DB layer; Forge applier receives deduplicated hint stream; zero-vector summaries filtered at provider boundary.

### W2-9: Manual CLI Surface Location (Roger)

**Scope:** Composition root for Wave 2 manual orchestration

**Decision:** Created new `packages/runtime-cli/` workspace package with bin entry `forge-prescribe`. This package is the explicit composition root that can legally import both `@akubly/cairn` and `@akubly/forge`.

**Rationale:** Repo already exposes binaries from package-level `bin` entries (e.g., `@akubly/cairn`). Wave 2 needs composition root without creating package cycles. `packages/runtime-cli` keeps boundary honest and buildable. Local invocation: `npx forge-prescribe --skill <id> [--db <path>]`.

**Implementation Details:**
- Per-skill → global profile fallback: Try canonical `(granularity='per-skill', granularity_key='global')` first, then fall back to `global/global`
- Exit codes: `0` on success (including zero hints or dedup skips), `1` when no profile found, `2` for arg/DB/persistence errors
- CLI tests: 4 passing (happy path, no-profile, empty result, mixed)

**Impact:** Wave 2 has manual trigger surface independent of Curator. Wave 3 will migrate to Curator-driven automatic orchestration. Package boundary preserved for future Phase 5 cloud wiring.

### W2-6: E2E Pipeline Test Location + Spec Ambiguity Note (Laura)

**Scope:** Integration test placement and discovered spec mismatch

**Decision:** Placed Wave 2 end-to-end pipeline test in `packages/forge/src/__tests__/wave2-pipeline.test.ts`. Forge is focal point because `runForgePrescribers()` is consumer ingesting Cairn summaries and emitting final hints applier sees.

**Spec Ambiguity Discovered:** `docs/forge-phase4.6-wave2-scope.md` §6.1 says `meanNetImpact = -0.2` should yield `autoApplyEligible = false`, but live Forge/Cairn logic and Alexander's W2-5 tests treat boundary as still eligible (`meanNetImpact >= NEGATIVE_IMPACT_AUTO_APPLY_GATE`). Test kept aligned with implementation + §4.5 semantics. **Action item:** Reconcile boundary explicitly in Wave 3 (pending ADR).

**Rationale:** Forge already hosts substantive integration coverage under `packages/forge/src/__tests__/`. New test stays with existing cross-module surface instead of one-off harness. To avoid production dependency from Forge to Cairn, test imports Cairn source directly and Forge's `tsconfig.json` excludes test files from package build.

**Test Coverage:** Full maturity gradient (0 vectors → mature catastrophic), dedup regression on repeated persistence, provider omission, fail-open behavior, shared `ChangeVectorSummary` contract flow.

**Impact:** Real SQLite path fully validated; attenuation + `autoApplyEligible` propagation verified end-to-end; provider fail-open semantics confirmed.

### W3-D1: Composition Root → R2 (`@akubly/skillsmith-runtime`)

**Scope:** Where should the runtime that imports both `@akubly/cairn` and `@akubly/forge` live?

**Decision:** Adopt R2 — new `@akubly/skillsmith-runtime` library package (composition layer importing both) plus thin `@akubly/runtime-cli` wrapper.

**Rationale:** Clean separation of concerns, best test isolation, zero build-order risks, Phase 5-portable. Roger and Alexander independently converged on this architecture.

**Status:** Accepted by Aaron 2026-05-22

**Impact:** Unblocks all Wave 3 work items

### W3-D2: Package Name → `@akubly/skillsmith-runtime`

**Scope:** What name for the new composition library package?

**Decision:** Use `@akubly/skillsmith-runtime` (domain-specific, not generic `@akubly/runtime`).

**Rationale:** Domain-specific naming (a) fits the cairn/forge metaphor, (b) describes what operates on (skills), (c) leaves room for future additions (scheduler, dashboard, policy engine).

**Status:** Accepted by Aaron 2026-05-22

**Impact:** Naming locked; packaging can proceed

### W3-D3: MCP Tool Exposure → Dropped from Wave 3

**Scope:** Should Wave 3 include an MCP tool for manual prescriber invocation?

**Decision:** No — Wave 3 ships with no MCP tool exposure. Curator hook is autonomous surface; CLI is manual surface.

**Rationale:** Proposed `run_prescriber_optimization` tool offers no net-new capability over existing CLI. Defer to later wave when concrete operator need surfaces. Removes W3-6, W3-7, ~2 MCP scenarios from W3-9 (~7 items, ~18 tests).

**Status:** Accepted by Aaron 2026-05-22

**Impact:** Wave 3 scope reduced; MCP tool re-opens only when operator need materializes

### W3-D4: Curator Hook Invocation → Always-On

**Scope:** Should Curator automatically invoke prescriber orchestration in v1?

**Decision:** Yes — automatic invocation always enabled. No opt-in flag in v1.

**Rationale:** Existing safety rails (negative-impact attenuation, hint dedup, fail-open semantics) are sufficient. Opt-in flag adds config without meaningful safety benefit.

**Status:** Accepted by Aaron 2026-05-22

**Locked Design:** Hint persistence stays in orchestrator; fail-open codified; profile selection trigger-driven only (global fallback deferred to Wave 4).

**Impact:** Unlocks automatic hint flow; enables Wave 3 implementation

## Wave 3 Research Notes

### Research: Composition Root Audit (Roger)

**Date:** 2026-05-23  
**Status:** Research input, delivered to ADR synthesis

**Scope:** Five options for where the runtime that imports both `@akubly/cairn` and `@akubly/forge` should live.

**Option Summary:**

| Option | Package Structure | Build Risk | Test Isolation | Phase 5 Portability | Recommendation |
|--------|-------------------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| R1 | Forge imports Cairn | Medium | Medium | Low | Do not use |
| R2 | New runtime package | Low | High | High | ✓ Recommended |
| R3 | Optional Cairn import of Forge | Medium | Medium | Medium | Fallback |
| R4 | Runtime-cli dual-mode | Low | Medium | High | Alternative |
| R5 | New curator package | Low | High | High | Alternative |

**Recommendation:** **R2** — Separate `@akubly/runtime` (composition library) + thin `@akubly/runtime-cli` (CLI wrapper).

**Why:** Clean roles, best test isolation, zero build risks, Phase 5-ready. Library stays portable.

**Fallback:** R4 (new `@akubly/curator` package) if team prefers explicit orchestrator semantics.

**Do not use:** R3 (inject Forge into Cairn hooks). Test coupling + build-order risks unacceptable.

### Research: Curator/MCP Integration Surface (Alexander)

**Date:** 2026-05-22  
**Status:** Research input, delivered to ADR synthesis

**Scope:** Wave 3 Curator–MCP integration requirements, architectural decisions, and open questions.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Composition Root Location:** New `@akubly/runtime` package (aligns with Roger's R2 recommendation).
2. **Invocation Strategy:** Hybrid — automatic via Curator hook + manual via MCP tool.
3. **Profile Selection (v1):** Trigger-driven only; defer global tier fallback to Wave 4.

**Secondary Decisions:**
- Eager Forge import (both packages co-deployed by assumption)
- `force=true` behavior: skip dedup (matches Wave 2 intent)
- Observable metrics: skills processed/skipped, hints generated/inserted/dedup'd, categories matched/attenuated
- Profile selection override: low-priority for v1; defer to Wave 4

**Curator API Changes:**
```typescript
export interface PrescriberOrchestrationConfig {
  runForSkill: (skillId: string, minSessions: number) 
    => Promise<{ skillId, hintsGenerated, hintsInserted, hintsDuplicated, hintsError }>;
  loadProfile?: (skillId: string) => ExecutionProfile | null;
}

export function curate(
  changeVectorConfig?: ChangeVectorConfig,
  prescriberOrchestrationConfig?: PrescriberOrchestrationConfig,
): CurateResult {
  // Signature is backward compatible (new param optional)
}
```

**MCP Tool:** `run_prescriber_optimization` (triggers orchestrator, returns structured output).
