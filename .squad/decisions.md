# Open Question: Brain/Memory/Learning System — Repo Placement

**Status:** Deliberation (Round 2 consulting, no final decision)  
**Date:** 2026-05-22  
**Requestor:** Aaron  
**Consulting Agents:** Graham Knight (Lead), Roger Wilco (Platform), Alexander (SDK/Runtime), Valanice (UX)

---

## The Question

Should a new agentic brain/memory/thinking/learning system be:
1. **NEW REPO** (@akubly/cortex, @akubly/synapse, etc.) — standalone product with independent release cadence
2. **NEW PACKAGE in this repo** (packages/mem/) — satellite package alongside Cairn/Forge
3. **EXTEND CAIRN** (same package) — Curator extension for pattern learning

---

## Agent Recommendations (Round 2, Refined)

### Graham Knight — NEW REPO (High conviction)

**Key insight:** Five-dimension expansion (TIERS, KINDS, PROPERTIES, ACTIVITIES, REPRESENTATION, ACQUISITION) confirms system boundary shift.

**Why:**
- User-memory tier is cross-repo infrastructure (cwd-aware hooks outside this monorepo)
- Brain is a **runtime** with control loops (meditate, dream, pray), not a library
- KINDS are ontological (practical, semantic, linguistic, symbolic, philosophical) — no overlap with Cairn's types
- PROPERTIES (recency, trustworthiness, plasticity) are learning primitives, not event signals
- REPRESENTATION (graph + versioning) differs from Cairn's SQLite + event log

**Verdict:** This isn't a Cairn extension. It's a product with zero hard dependencies on Cairn/Forge.

---

### Roger Wilco — NEW PACKAGE in Monorepo (Medium conviction, pragmatic)

**Key insight:** FLIPPED from "extend Curator." Multi-tier + polyglot system can't fit in Curator, but can fit as separate package.

**Why:**
- Monorepo velocity (shared build, shared types, single test suite)
- Cairn stays focused (project-level knowledge, not multi-scope router)
- Clean delegation: packages/mem/src/tiers/project.ts wraps Cairn Curator
- Tier/kind federation avoids schema conflicts and package boundary violations

**Trade-off:** Org-tier federation (multi-writer shared memory) still wants backend service later, but Phase 1-3 can use SQLite + Git.

**Verdict:** NEW PACKAGE as pragmatic step; extract to separate repo in Phase 5+ if org-tier backend service is needed.

---

### Alexander — NEW REPO (High conviction)

**Key insight:** FLIPPED from monorepo. Q3 (org-tier federation) reveals backend/deployment boundary.

**Why:**
- **Q1 (Runtime coupling):** Brain is Forge sibling, not layer on Forge — separate repo avoids confusion
- **Q2 (User-tier distribution):** CAN work from monorepo via npm, BUT separate repo enforces "no accidental Forge deps"
- **Q3 (Org-tier federation):** Wants Postgres + Azure Functions as separate deployment unit — this is the decisive factor

**Key argument:** The 5-dimension expansion is 10x scope increase. Original analysis (monorepo works) was correct for narrow scope; Graham's position is correct for expanded scope.

**Verdict:** If brain's org tier needs Postgres + backend service, it's a separate system boundary. Matches deployment boundaries, not just code boundaries.

---

### Valanice — NEW REPO with Phased Extraction (Medium conviction)

**Key insight:** Infrastructure positioning determines repo choice; mental model boundaries matter for discoverability.

**Why:**
- Brain is **infrastructure** (like Git, Redis) that follows the user globally and hooks per-repo
- Installation story: 
pm install -g @akubly/brain (not embedded in Cairn)
- Branding independence signals "infrastructure for any agentic system," not "Cairn feature"
- UX principle: Mental model boundaries should match repo boundaries

**Phased approach:**
- **MVP (Prototype in monorepo):** xperiments/brain/ or packages/brain/
- **Extract when:** Brain has independent CLI, MCP server, test suite, branding decision
- **Branding options:** Synapse, Mneme, Cortex, Engram

**Verdict:** Lean toward separate repo, but prototype in monorepo first to validate scope.

## Summary of Positions

| Agent | Position | Conviction | Reasoning Core |
|-------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Graham** | NEW REPO | 🟢 High | System boundary (5 dimensions) |
| **Roger** | NEW PACKAGE | 🟡 Medium | Pragmatic: monorepo velocity, can extract later |
| **Alexander** | NEW REPO | 🟢 High | Org-tier backend service = deployment boundary |
| **Valanice** | NEW REPO (phased) | 🟡 Medium | Infrastructure positioning + phased extraction |

**Consensus:** 3 agents recommend NEW REPO (Graham, Alexander, Valanice); 1 recommends NEW PACKAGE (Roger, pragmatic compromise).

## Open Questions for Aaron

1. **Is brain Cairn/Forge-exclusive, or infrastructure for any agentic system?**
   - If exclusive: NEW PACKAGE makes sense; Roger's approach is solid
   - If infrastructure: NEW REPO makes sense; Graham + Alexander + Valanice alignment is strong

2. **What's the MVP scope?**
   - If 2-week prototype: Keep in xperiments/brain/ for now
   - If 2-month full system: Decide repo placement before implementation

3. **Who is the primary user?**
   - If agents (LX-first): Infrastructure positioning → NEW REPO
   - If humans (UX-first): Could be either, but tooling/discovery favors NEW REPO

4. **How soon is org-tier federation needed?**
   - If Phase 1-2 MVP: SQLite + Git works, monorepo packaging is OK (Roger path)
   - If Phase 3+ scaling: Postgres + backend needed, repo boundary matters (Alexander path)

5. **Backend service story?**
   - If Postgres + sync service: Separate repo is cleaner (deployment boundary)
   - If stay local (SQLite + cwd-aware hooks): Either repo works

## Impact Analysis

### If NEW REPO
- **Coordination:** Separate squad, separate release cadence
- **Squad changes:** Forge + Types must publish to npm; Cairn depends on Brain
- **Timeline:** Phase 0-4 for brain squad (parallel to Phase 5 PGO)
- **Risk:** Version skew between Cairn and Brain

### If NEW PACKAGE in Monorepo
- **Coordination:** Same squad, shared build/test/types
- **Squad changes:** Create packages/mem/, implement tier delegation to Cairn
- **Timeline:** Integrate into main roadmap (maybe Phase 5 stretch goal)
- **Risk:** Org-tier federation later wants backend service (deployment boundary mismatch)

### If Extend Cairn
- **Rejected by all agents** — violates single responsibility, schema conflicts, architectural mismatch
