### 2026-06-02: M2 Cycle-2 Doc Alignment (Gabriel)

**Author:** Gabriel (Infrastructure)
**Date:** 2026-06-02T00:16Z
**PR:** #44 (branch squad/m2-forge-mcp-bash-hooks)
**Commit:** bacb3f4

Cycle-2 review (APPROVE_WITH_NITS) confirmed all three cycle-1 code fixes are correct. Two doc-drift nits addressed: (1) SKILL.md pattern #7 replaced — the original taught the two-pass sed approach that cycle-1 rejected as buggy; the updated pattern now shows the `_remove_block` bash state-machine that was actually shipped, with a new Anti-Pattern entry documenting the specific sequencing failure mode (blank-line pass consumes MARKER_START, orphaning the block body) and the byte-identical roundtrip acceptance criterion. (2) README uninstall description updated from "using sed (GNU/BSD)" to "pure-bash line-by-line filter (no sed dependency; identical behavior on Linux, macOS, and Git Bash on Windows)". Both changes are doc-only; no code or behavior changed. M2 is now review-complete and ready to merge.

### 2026-06-02: M2 Cycle-1 Fixes (Gabriel)

**Author:** Gabriel (Infrastructure)
**Date:** 2026-06-01T00:00Z
**PR:** #44 (branch squad/m2-forge-mcp-bash-hooks)
**Commit:** e7ef8f3

## Findings addressed

### F1 — BLOCKING — uninstall.sh two-pass sed

**Root cause:** The first sed pass consumed MARKER_START when it appeared immediately after a blank line (the two patterns match the same region). This made the second range-delete pass a no-op — block body and MARKER_END stayed in the file. Subsequent install runs appended a new block on top of the orphan.

**Fix:** Replaced both sed passes with a single bash state-machine loop. Buffers blank lines one-deep; suppresses the separator blank only when MARKER_START immediately follows.

**Verification:** install → uninstall → byte-identical (cycle 1 and cycle 2) against a synthetic bashrc with existing content, ran via Git Bash.

### F2 — IMPORTANT — shell-init.sh: npm root -g on foreground path

**Root cause:** `_forge_mcp_resolve_script` was called before the `&` so the 150ms–1s+ `npm root -g` shell-out blocked every new interactive session.

**Fix:** Moved both resolution and `node` execution into the background subshell (`( ... ) &>/dev/null &`). Subshell inherits `_forge_mcp_resolve_script` (bash forks copy parent functions). Shell startup path is now a single `( ) &` with no blocking work.

### F3 — MEDIUM — shell-init.sh: pkg_json dirname depth

**Root cause:** Two `dirname` calls landed in `dist/` (no package.json there). Path: `dist/hooks/sessionStart.js` → `dist/hooks` → `dist`.

**Fix:** Three `dirname` calls reach the package root: `dist/hooks` → `dist` → `skillsmith-runtime`. `forge_mcp_check` now prints `version: 0.1.0`. Verified against the actual `packages/skillsmith-runtime/package.json`.

### 2026-05-31: Decision Drop: M1 Hint Consumption MCP Tools (Roger)

**Author:** Roger (Platform Dev)
**Date:** 2026-05-31T19:04:59Z
**Issue:** #39
**PR:** #40

---

## Context

Forge produces `optimization_hints` in the cairn DB but there was no way for Aaron to see or act on them from Copilot. `get_status` mentioned "N new suggestions" but the content was invisible. This PR closes that gap.

---

## Final Tool Surfaces

### `list_optimization_hints`

**Kind:** Read-only MCP tool
**Inputs:**

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| `status` | enum (pending/accepted/applied/rejected/deferred/expired/suppressed/failed) | — | Omit to return active hints (pending+accepted+deferred) |
| `skill_id` | string | — | Optional filter by skill |
| `limit` | integer 1–100 | 20 | Max hints returned |

**Output fields per hint:** `id`, `skill_id`, `source`, `category`, `summary`, `recommendation`, `impact_score`, `confidence_level` (high/medium/emerging), `status`, `created_at`, `resolution_note`
**Envelope:** `{ count, active_count, hints[] }`

---

### `resolve_optimization_hint`

**Kind:** Mutating MCP tool
**Inputs:**

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `hint_id` | string | ✅ | Hint ID from `list_optimization_hints` |
| `resolution` | `resolved` \| `dismissed` | ✅ | `resolved` = manually addressed; `dismissed` = not acting on it |
| `note` | string | — | Optional reason |

**Output:** `{ hint_id, resolution, status, resolution_note, already_resolved, message }`
**Idempotent:** Yes — if hint is already in a terminal state, returns current state with `already_resolved: true` and no error.
**Internal mapping:** Both dispositions transition to `rejected` status; `resolution` field and `resolution_note` preserve user intent.

---

## Schema / Migration

**Migration 017** (`packages/cairn/src/db/migrations/017-hint-resolution-note.ts`)

- Adds `resolution_note TEXT` column to `optimization_hints`
- **Version:** 17 (bumped from 16)
- **Guarded:** Checks `sqlite_master` for table existence before ALTER (partial-schema test DB safety)
- **Idempotent:** Uses `PRAGMA table_info` to skip if column already exists
- **Timestamp convention:** No new timestamp column needed; existing `applied_at` pattern is sufficient

---

## New DB Helper

`resolveOptimizationHint(db, id, resolution, note?)` in `optimizationHints.ts`

- Explicit `db: Database.Database` injection (per project convention)
- New types: `HintResolution = 'resolved' | 'dismissed'`, `ResolveHintResult`
- `OptimizationHintRow` extended with `resolutionNote: string | null`
- Wraps in `db.transaction().immediate()` for atomicity

---

## Test Counts

| | Count |
|---|---|
| Before (cairn suite) | 693 |
| Added (hintMcp.test.ts) | +15 |
| **After** | **708** |

New tests cover: list backing logic, resolveOptimizationHint DB helper, migration 017 schema check.
Four other test files updated: version assertion 16 → 17 (db, discovery, migration012, prescriptions).

---

## Build / Test Status

- `npm run build` — ✅ green
- `npm test --workspace=@akubly/cairn` — ✅ 708/708 passing
### 2026-05-31: M7-A — Typed Error Hierarchy for applyFeedback / applyFeedbackById (Edgar)

**Author:** Edgar (Learning Systems Specialist)
**Date:** 2026-05-31
**Branch:** `eureka/m7-a-typed-errors`
**Status:** SHIPPED (PR #38 opened)

**Decision:** Introduce a typed error class hierarchy in `packages/eureka/src/activities/errors.ts`, replacing all six generic `throw new Error/TypeError/RangeError(...)` sites in `applyFeedback` and `applyFeedbackById` with domain-specific typed subclasses.

**Error classes introduced:**
- `FactNotFoundError` (extends `Error`) — FactReader returns `null`
- `InvalidFeedbackOptionsError` (extends `Error`) — `correctionDelta` undefined for `user_correction`
- `InvalidTrustValueError` (extends `RangeError`) — value non-finite/out-of-range
- `FactReaderContractError` (extends `TypeError`) — FactReader returns `undefined`
- `UnhandledFeedbackEventError` (extends `TypeError`) — exhaustive `switch` `never` branch

**Discriminator pattern:** Every class carries `readonly code: '<CODE>'` for narrowing without `instanceof`.

**Canonical narrowing policy (M7-A Cycle 1):** Use `err.code === '...'` as the **primary** discriminator. `instanceof` is convenience-only — it can fail across ESM realms. `code` is realm-safe. M7-B narrowing tests will exercise `code` exclusively.

**Rationale:** (1) Caller narrowing — generic throws are indistinguishable. (2) Zero behavior change — all 40 existing tests pass without modification. (3) M7-B prep — `code` discriminators are the primary hook for exhaustive narrowing. (4) Message preservation. (5) `Object.setPrototypeOf` defensive call in constructors.

**Open Follow-ups:**
- M7-B: Exhaustive instanceof + code narrowing tests (Laura)
- M7-C: Real FactReader contract test; atomicity contract design (Crispin/Edgar)
- M7-D: `applyFeedbackById` user_correction regression locks (Laura)

**Files Changed:**
- `packages/eureka/src/activities/errors.ts` — NEW (5 typed error classes)
- `packages/eureka/src/activities/recall.ts` — updated imports, throw sites, JSDoc @throws
- `packages/eureka/src/index.ts` — barrel exports for all 5 error classes

### 2026-05-31: Eureka M7-A Review Cycle — 3-Cycle Closure (Edgar, Correctness, Skeptic, Craft, Compliance)

**Date:** 2026-05-31
**Branch:** `eureka/m7-a-typed-errors`
**PR:** #38
**Status:** REVIEW-COMPLETE. Ready for ship decision.

**Summary:** M7-A underwent a 3-cycle review process with a rotating 4-person panel (Correctness, Skeptic, Craft, Compliance). Each cycle ran independent reviews; findings were triaged and acted upon, followed by re-review to confirm closure. All 40 tests remained green throughout.

| Cycle | Findings | Breakdown | Disposition | Commits |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Cycle 1** | 13 total | 1 Blocking, 5 Important, 7 Minor | 11 ACCEPT, 2 REJECT-defer | 09710dc |
| **Cycle 2** | 3 total | 0 Blocking, 1 Important, 2 Minor | 3 ACCEPT, 0 REJECT | 6563ca3, 927a508 |
| **Cycle 3** | — | (lightweight fix-only, no re-review) | — | — |

**Cycle 1 Findings (11 ACCEPT, 2 REJECT):**
- **F1 [Correctness] ACCEPT:** Added `readonly event: string` field to `UnhandledFeedbackEventError`.
- **F2 [Skeptic] ACCEPT:** Declared canonical narrowing policy: `err.code === '...'` as primary discriminator; secondary: `instanceof`.
- **F3 [Skeptic] REJECT-defer:** Base class `EurekaError` deferred to M7-B (narrowing tests phase).
- **F4 [Skeptic] ACCEPT:** Documented `.name` behavior change with explicit acknowledgment.
- **F5 [Compliance] ACCEPT:** Added missing `@throws` entries for `applyFeedbackById`.
- **F6 [Craft] ACCEPT:** Clarified `Object.setPrototypeOf` rationale comment (defensive for ES5 bundlers).
- **F7 [Craft] ACCEPT:** Removed redundant `as const` on readonly discriminators.
- **F8 [Craft] ACCEPT:** Documented open signature on `InvalidFeedbackOptionsError` constructor.
- **F9 [Craft] ACCEPT:** Merged duplicate `@throws {InvalidTrustValueError}` entries.
- **F10 [Craft] ACCEPT:** Reordered `@throws` to match runtime check sequence.
- **F11 [Craft] ACCEPT:** Added TODO comment for M7-B: purpose-specific `InvalidDeltaValueError`.
- **F12 [Skeptic] ACCEPT:** Updated "dual-pkg" comment to reflect ESM-only reality.
- **F13 [Correctness] REJECT:** JSON serialization edge case flagged for information only.

**Cycle 2 Findings (3 ACCEPT, 0 REJECT):**
- **F14 [Craft/Documentation] ACCEPT:** Corrected `@throws` order inversion from Cycle 1 F10 (FactReaderContractError before FactNotFoundError).
- **F15 [Craft] ACCEPT:** Consolidated `Object.setPrototypeOf` rationale to file header (DRY).
- **F16 [Craft] ACCEPT:** Replaced non-idiomatic "open signature" phrasing with clearer language.

**Files Changed (Cycles 1+2):**
- `packages/eureka/src/activities/errors.ts` — All 5 error classes + comments
- `packages/eureka/src/activities/recall.ts` — All throw sites + JSDoc
- `.squad/decisions.md` — Canonical narrowing policy line

**Test Result:** 40/40 passing throughout all cycles. Build clean.

### 2026-05-30: Coordinator Spawn Prompt — Gitignore Path Policy (Graham)

**Author:** Graham (Lead)
**Date:** 2026-05-30
**Trigger:** PR #34 Copilot review threads 8, 9, 10 — gitignore violations
**Status:** Resolved (commit daf5f28 + concurrent cleanup in 4d4378b)

**Decision:** The Coordinator's spawn prompt to Scribe **must not** list `.squad/orchestration-log/`, `.squad/log/`, or any other gitignored runtime-state path as an allowed write path.

**Allowed Scribe-write paths (exhaustive list):**
- `.squad/decisions.md`
- `.squad/decisions-archive.md`
- `.squad/agents/{name}/history.md`
- `.squad/agents/{name}/history-archive.md`
- `.squad/identity/now.md`

**Explicitly prohibited (gitignored runtime state):**
- `.squad/orchestration-log/` — agent orchestration logs
- `.squad/log/` — session summary logs
- `decision inbox drop ` — transient decision queue (consumed by Scribe, not committed)
- `.squad/sessions/` — session data
- `.squad/.scratch/` — scratch space

**Context:** In the M5+M6 review cycle (PR #34), spawn instructions to Scribe incorrectly listed `log/` and `orchestration-log/` as committed paths. Scribe committed 35 files across these directories, all covered by `.gitignore` lines 49-52. This is a coordinator error — Scribe followed instructions correctly.

**Remediation Applied:**
- `git rm -r --cached .squad/orchestration-log/ .squad/log/` — untracked 34 + 1 files
- `git rm test_results.txt` — removed local junk artifact
- `.gitignore` updated for `test_results.txt`

**Action Required:** Coordinator (Graham) — Update Scribe spawn prompt template to enforce allowed-paths list and add note that runtime-state directories are never committed.

### 2026-05-31: M7-B + M7-D Complete (Laura)

**Author:** Laura (Tester)
**Date:** 2026-05-31
**Branch:** `eureka/m7-bd-narrowing-regression`
**Status:** COMPLETE — local branch, awaiting Aaron's ship decision

#### M7-B — Exhaustive error narrowing tests
**File:** `packages/eureka/src/activities/__tests__/feedback-error-narrowing.test.ts`
**Tests:** 14 new tests across 6 groups

Proves the realm-safe narrowing contract for all 5 error classes in `errors.ts`:
- Group 1 (5 tests): Code-based narrowing (primary) — code, fields, message, name per class
- Group 2 (1 test): Exhaustive code-discriminator switch — canonical caller pattern
- Group 3 (3 tests): Inheritance preservation — instanceof (realm-convenience, documented)
- Group 4 (3 tests): source discrimination on InvalidTrustValueError — 'input' × 2, 'storage' × 1
- Group 5 (1 test): InvalidFeedbackOptionsError.field discriminator
- Group 6 (1 test): UnhandledFeedbackEventError runtime-cast path

#### M7-D — applyFeedbackById user_correction regression locks
**File:** `packages/eureka/src/activities/__tests__/feedback-by-id-regression.test.ts`
**Tests:** 8 new tests

Locks the user_correction value-plumbing and error-ordering contracts.

#### Test Counts
| Baseline (pre-M7-B/D) | M7-B | M7-D | Total |
|-----------------------|------|------|-------|
| 40                    | 14   | 8    | **62** |

All 62 pass. Build clean (tsc exits 0). No production code changes.

#### Deferred Items Uncovered
- **InvalidDeltaValueError purpose-specific class:** Currently `correctionDelta` non-finite path reuses `InvalidTrustValueError(source:'input')`. A TODO at recall.ts:325 flags this for M7-B follow-up — deferred, not blocking.
- **M7-C atomicity contract:** Unchanged. Crispin/Edgar ownership.

**Files Added (test files only):**
- `packages/eureka/src/activities/__tests__/feedback-error-narrowing.test.ts` — NEW
- `packages/eureka/src/activities/__tests__/feedback-by-id-regression.test.ts` — NEW

**Files Modified:**
- `.squad/agents/laura/history.md` — updated status, appended M7-B+M7-D learnings

### 2026-05-31: Cycle 1 F7 Reversal — `as const` Restored (Edgar)

**Date:** 2026-05-31
**Author:** Edgar (Learning Systems Specialist)
**PR:** #38 (`eureka/m7-a-typed-errors`)
**Branch:** `eureka/m7-a-typed-errors`
**Status:** CLOSED — F7 reversal committed

#### What
Reverted Cycle 1 F7 finding and all downstream documentation that propagated it. F7 had instructed switching discriminator declarations from:
```typescript
readonly code = 'FACT_NOT_FOUND' as const;
```
to:
```typescript
readonly code: 'FACT_NOT_FOUND' = 'FACT_NOT_FOUND';
```

Cycle 3 (commit f8f94c3) further propagated that preference into SKILL.md with explicit "Do not use `as const`" callouts. This revert restores `as const` form in both `errors.ts` (5 sites) and `SKILL.md`.

#### Why
The repo's ESLint config enforces **`@typescript-eslint/prefer-as-const` as an error**. The explicit-annotation form violates that rule — CI on Node 20 and Node 22 failed with 5 identical errors:
```
  42:18  error  Expected a `const` assertion instead of a literal type annotation  @typescript-eslint/prefer-as-const
```

The enforced lint rule is the **authoritative voice** on code style. The F7 Craft persona critique was reasonable stylistically but missed the enforced rule entirely. The `as const` form was correct all along.

#### Lesson
**Personas can have stylistic opinions; the repo's enforced lint config trumps them.** Before accepting any Code Panel finding that changes code form/style, cross-check it against the repo's actual ESLint/TypeScript config. A finding that produces a lint violation is automatically incorrect, regardless of how reasonable it sounds.

### 2026-05-31: Aaron's M7-C Direction Decision (Atomicity Contract)

**Decision Owner:** Aaron (Lead)
**Date:** 2026-05-31
**Session:** M7 continuation (M7-B + M7-D landed; M7-C in flight)
**Status:** DIRECTION LOCKED — mutate callback pattern selected

#### The Question
How should `applyFeedbackById` address the non-atomic read-then-write sequence in FactReader → Trust Math → TrustUpdater? Three options were evaluated:

**(a) Caller-side serialization:** Caller wraps `applyFeedbackById` in a lock/mutex before calling.
**(b) CAS token:** Return a token from read, require token in write; abort if token stale.
**(c) Mutate callback:** Push read-modify-write logic into seam; receive callback that performs write inside read lock.

#### Decision
**Aaron selected option (c) — mutate callback pattern.**

#### Rationale
Pushing read-modify-write into the seam (FactReader/TrustUpdater boundary) keeps the activity layer pure and makes correctness a storage-layer property. This is the most maintainable pattern:
- Activity layer doesn't need to know about atomicity concerns
- Storage layer becomes the source of truth for atomic compound operations
- Callback captures the exact semantics ("given current trust, apply this delta")
- No leaky abstractions — caller doesn't need to understand serialization

#### Implementation Status
- Crispin (FactReader Specialist): Implementing mutate callback interface in FactReader
- Edgar (Learning Systems Specialist): Integrating callback into applyFeedbackById call site
- Tracking branch: `eureka/m7-c-atomicity`

#### Next Coordination
Scribe will log completion once Edgar and Crispin finish. Coordinator will spawn verification when both agents report COMPLETE.

### 2026-05-31: M7-C Complete — Edgar (TrustUpdater.mutate atomicity)

**Author:** Edgar (Learning Systems Specialist)
**Date:** 2026-05-31
**Branch:** `eureka/m7-c-atomicity`
**Status:** COMPLETE — PR #41

**Contract shape:**
```ts
export interface TrustUpdater {
  mutate(args: {
    factId: string;
    sessionId: SessionId;
    fn: (currentTrust: number) => number;
  }): Promise<void>;
}
```

**Atomicity guarantee:** The storage implementation MUST execute read, fn-application, and write as a single atomic operation per (sessionId, factId) pair. Storage MUST scope state by (sessionId, factId); a mutate on one sessionId MUST NOT affect another. If `fn` throws, write is aborted. If `fn` returns non-finite or out-of-range [0,1], storage MUST throw `InvalidTrustValueError(source:'storage')`. Variant B: `currentTrust` removed from `ApplyFeedbackOptions`; `applyFeedbackById` is a zero-logic thin wrapper.

**Test count delta:** 62 → 69 (+7 contract tests, C-1..C-7). All green.

**Breaking API changes:** `TrustUpdater.update` → `TrustUpdater.mutate`; `ApplyFeedbackOptions.currentTrust` removed; `ApplyFeedbackByIdDeps.factReader` removed.

---

### 2026-05-31: M7-C Complete — Crispin (InMemoryFactReader + contract suite)

**Author:** Crispin (Knowledge Representation Specialist)
**Date:** 2026-05-31
**Branch:** `eureka/m7-c-factreader` (merged into `eureka/m7-c-atomicity` via PR #41)
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Decision:** In-memory FactReader (option i). No SQLite — Eureka has no persistence layer yet; SQLite deferred to M8-storage when FactStore.search() schema is locked.

**Implementation:** `packages/eureka/src/storage/fact-reader.ts` — `InMemoryFactReader` backed by `Map<factId, Array<{trust, sessionId}>>`. Session-scoped; trust passthrough (NaN returned as-is; validation is caller's job).

**Contract test pattern:** `runFactReaderContract(implName, makeHarness)` — shared helper in `fact-reader.contract.test.ts`. Invariants: CL-1 read existing fact, CL-2 read missing → null, CL-3 session isolation, CL-4 trust passthrough, CL-5 shape contract. Adding a new impl requires one `runFactReaderContract(...)` call — zero test duplication.

**Test count delta:** 62 → 67 (+5 contract tests).

**Rationale for in-memory choice:** No DB idiom exists in Eureka; introducing SQLite pre-FactStore schema would be premature. The contract suite is designed so SQLite wires in trivially in M8+ by passing a factory to `runFactReaderContract`.

## Eureka M5+M6 Review Cycle

### 2026-05-30: M5+M6 Branch Preparation (Graham)

**Author:** Graham
**Date:** 2026-05-30
**Status:** Complete
**Branch:** `eureka/m5-m6-trust-feedback`

After the M5+M6 RED→GREEN cascade, a working-tree loss incident occurred during branch creation. The sequence `git switch -c <feature>` → `git switch main` → `git reset --hard origin/main` wiped tracked modifications, leaving only untracked files. Recovery was performed via faithful reimplementation from test contracts (`recall-feedback.test.ts`).

**Correct sequence going forward:** Commit implementation on feature branch BEFORE switching back to main to reset, or use `git stash`.

**Final state:**
- Branch created at commit ac8c845
- 29/29 tests green, build clean
- Two-commit structure: implementation+tests+spec (commit A) + team metadata (commit B)
- main branch reset to origin/main at ef06238 (clean, no force-push)

### 2026-05-30: M6 RED — user_correction Contract Lock + Read-Seam (Laura)

**Author:** Laura (Tester)
**Date:** 2026-05-30
**Beat:** M6 RED — two sub-beats: M6-A (user_correction contract) + M6-B (FactReader read-seam)

**Test counts:** 22 existing → 26 GREEN + 3 RED (29 total)

#### M6-A: user_correction Contract

M6-A1–A4 are regression locks on arithmetic already implemented in M5 (mild §55 deviation — implementation preceded contract). M6-A5 is the true RED: missing `correctionDelta` when `event='user_correction'` must throw.

**Fixtures verified:**
- M6-A1: 0.50 + 0.30 → 0.80 (no clamp)
- M6-A2: 0.80 + 0.30 → 1.00 (ceiling clamp)
- M6-A3: 0.50 - 0.30 → 0.20 (no clamp)
- M6-A4: 0.20 - 0.30 → 0.00 (floor clamp)

**M6-A5 contract:** `correctionDelta` is REQUIRED when `event='user_correction'`. Omitting it is a programming error; activity must throw rather than silently apply 0-delta.

#### M6-B: Read-Seam (FactReader)

**Shape decision:** New `applyFeedbackById` function (higher-level orchestrator) rather than extending `applyFeedback`.

**FactReader interface:**
```typescript
interface FactReader {
  read(args: { factId: string; sessionId: SessionId }): Promise<{ trust: number } | null>;
}
```

Rationale: Returns object (not bare number) to leave room for future fields without signature change. Null means fact not found.

**applyFeedbackById tests:**
- M6-B1 (happy path): FactReader returns `{ trust: 0.60 }`, corroboration → TrustUpdater called with 0.70
- M6-B2 (null guard): FactReader returns `null` → activity throws, TrustUpdater NOT called

**Edgar's implementation guidance (M6 GREEN):**
1. Call `deps.factReader.read({ factId, sessionId })`
2. If null, throw (fact not found)
3. Call `applyFeedback` with current trust from result
4. All 29 tests (26 existing + 3 RED) must pass

### 2026-05-30: M5+M6 Review Wave — Code Panel Findings (Edgar)

**Author:** Edgar (Learning Systems Specialist)
**Date:** 2026-05-30
**Context:** 5-persona Code Panel review findings on M5+M6 (trust-feedback mutation)

#### Finding Triage Summary

| ID | Finding | Verdict | Key Details |
|---|---------|---------|-------------|
| F1 | Public API not exported | ACCEPT | Barrel-export `applyFeedback`, `applyFeedbackById`, `FeedbackEvent`, `TrustUpdater`, `FactReader` via `index.ts` |
| F2 | TOCTOU in applyFeedbackById | ACCEPT (doc) | Non-atomic read-then-write. JSDoc `@concurrency` clause added. Deferred: M7-C (backend-side atomicity). |
| F3 | Unused `clock` dep | ACCEPT | Removed `clock: ClockProvider` from `ApplyFeedbackDeps` and `ApplyFeedbackByIdDeps`. Clock stays in `recallWithScores`. |
| F4 | No exhaustiveness check | ACCEPT | Converted `applyFeedback` `if/else if/else` to exhaustive `switch` with `never` branch. |
| F5 | Inline types break pattern | ACCEPT | Extracted all 4 interfaces: `ApplyFeedbackOptions`, `ApplyFeedbackDeps`, `ApplyFeedbackByIdOptions`, `ApplyFeedbackByIdDeps`. |
| F6 | No input validation on currentTrust | ACCEPT | Added `RangeError` guard: `currentTrust` must be in [0,1]. Fires before `TrustUpdater.update()`. |
| F7 | Stale comment | ACCEPT | Removed "Trust score updates..." bullet from `recallWithScores` JSDoc (already implemented). |
| F11 | Incomplete @throws JSDoc | ACCEPT | Added `@throws` clauses covering propagated errors from `applyFeedback` and new `RangeError` guards. |
| F12 | Stricter null/undefined guard | ACCEPT (combined with F6) | Changed to strict null checks; expanded guard contracts in spec. |

**Changes made:**
- `packages/eureka/src/activities/recall.ts`: F1-exports, F2-TOCTOU JSDoc, F3-clock removed, F4-switch exhaustive, F5-named interfaces, F6-input validation, F7-stale comment, F11-@throws
- `packages/eureka/src/index.ts`: F1+F5 barrel-export additions (9 new exports)
- `docs/eureka/sections/30-learning-systems.md` §2.3: F3-clock scope, F5-interface shapes, F6-guard contracts

**Build/Test Status:** ✅ clean build, 29/29 tests passing

### 2026-05-30: M5+M6 Review Wave — Code Panel Findings (Laura)

**Author:** Laura (Tester)
**Date:** 2026-05-30
**Context:** Code Panel review findings on RED tests + implementation. Laura owns `recall-feedback.test.ts`.

#### Finding Triage Summary

| ID | Finding | Verdict | Action |
|---|---------|---------|--------|
| F8 | Idempotent boundary not pinned | ACCEPT | Added 2 tests: ceiling (currentTrust=1.0 → 1.0), floor (0.0 → 0.0) |
| F9 | Float equality fragility | ACCEPT | Wrapped all 9 trust assertions in `expect.closeTo(value, 5)` |
| F10 | Stale `±0.30` header comment | ACCEPT | Updated to actual formula: `min(1.0, max(0.0, trust + correctionDelta))` |
| F-NEW-EXHAUSTIVE | Unknown event type TypeError | ACCEPT | Added regression lock for exhaustiveness guard |
| F-NEW-RANGE | Input validation RangeError | ACCEPT | Added 4 regression locks (NaN, <0, >1 on currentTrust + delegation path) |
| F-NEW-PROPAGATION | Missing correctionDelta via byId | ACCEPT | Added test: `applyFeedbackById` with missing delta propagates error |

**Float precision decision (F9):** Chose `closeTo(value, 5)` over suggested 10. Reasoning:
- 5 decimal digits (±0.000005) is strict enough to catch wrong delta calculations
- IEEE-754 jitter for these operands is 1e-16 — well inside 1e-5 tolerance
- 10 digits is overkill; 5 is defensible middle ground

**Test count delta:** 29 → 37 (+8 tests). Target per brief: 36+. Achieved 37.

**Clock coordination note (for Edgar):** All new tests retain `clock: fixedClock` pending Edgar's F3 commit (clock removal). Once F3 lands, drop clock from all 16 applyFeedback/applyFeedbackById call sites and remove `fixedClock` helper.

**Validation:** `npm test --workspace=@akubly/eureka` → 37/37 passed

### 2026-05-30: M5+M6 Cycle 2 Review Findings (Edgar)

**Author:** Edgar (Learning Systems Specialist)
**Date:** 2026-05-30
**Branch:** eureka/m5-m6-trust-feedback
**Triggered by:** Review-cycle cycle 2 (Skeptic + Architect panels)

#### Cycle 2 Findings

| ID | Finding | Triage | Summary |
|---|---------|--------|---------|
| F-C2-1 | correctionDelta unvalidated for NaN/Infinity | ACCEPT | Added `RangeError` guard after `undefined` check, before trust math. Guards consistency with M5 `currentTrust` validation. |
| F-C2-2 | @concurrency JSDoc overpromises | ACCEPT | Rewrote to present both options: (1) caller-side serialization (v1), (2) backend-side atomicity (deferred M7-C). Clarified M7-C scope. |
| F-C2-3 | FactReader contract drift | ACCEPT (Option A) | Three-layer misalignment (interface vs impl vs spec). Chose strict null: interface `Promise<{trust:number}\|null>`, guard `fact === null`, spec updated. |

**Build/Test Status:** ✅ clean build, 37/37 tests passing

**Coordination notes for Laura:**
- Suggest adding `correctionDelta` NaN guard test (low priority, can land with current wave)
- F-C2-3 impact on Laura's tests: zero — all existing null tests use `mockResolvedValue(null)`

### 2026-05-30: M5+M6 Cycle 2 Changes (Laura)

**Author:** Laura (Tester)
**Date:** 2026-05-30
**Branch:** eureka/m5-m6-trust-feedback

Cycle 2 review consensus identified stale `clock: fixedClock` injections carried through all feedback-path call sites after Edgar removed `ClockProvider` from `ApplyFeedbackDeps` / `ApplyFeedbackByIdDeps` in cycle 1. Test dir excluded from tsc, so excess-property checking never fired.

**Changes (recall-feedback.test.ts only):**
- `applyFeedback` call sites cleaned: 15
- `applyFeedbackById` call sites cleaned: 4
- `fixedClock` const removed: yes
- `FIXED_NOW_MS` const removed: yes
- Block comment updated: clock now scoped to recall/recallWithScores only, NOT feedback path

**Validation:** `npm test --workspace=@akubly/eureka` → 37/37 passed

### 2026-05-30: M6 GREEN — correctionDelta Guard + FactReader (Edgar)

**Author:** Edgar (Learning Systems Specialist)
**Date:** 2026-05-30
**Beat:** M6 GREEN
**Status:** LANDED — GREEN (29/29 tests pass, tsc clean, all 37/37 after Laura's wave)

#### Test Count Delta

| Suite | Before M6 | After M6 | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| `recall.test.ts` (M1–M4) | 18 | 18 | — |
| `recall-feedback.test.ts` M5 (C1/C2) | 4 | 4 | — |
| `recall-feedback.test.ts` M6-A1–A4 (regression locks) | 4 | 4 | — |
| `recall-feedback.test.ts` M6-A5 (correctionDelta guard) | 0 RED | 1 GREEN | +1 |
| `recall-feedback.test.ts` M6-B1–B2 (applyFeedbackById) | 0 RED | 2 GREEN | +2 |
| **Total** | **26 (3 RED)** | **29 GREEN** | **+3** |

#### Error Semantics Chosen

**M6-A5 — Missing correctionDelta:**
- Error: base `Error` (not typed)
- Message: `'applyFeedback: correctionDelta is required when event is user_correction'`
- Placement: top of function, before event-branch switch
- Rationale: Input-validation concern; guards before any side effects

**M6-B2 — FactReader returns null:**
- Error: base `Error`
- Message: `'applyFeedbackById: fact not found — factId=<factId>'`
- Guarantee: `trustUpdater.update` NOT called
- Future refinement (M7): typed error narrowing (e.g., `FactNotFoundError`)

#### Implementation Pattern: Delegation Over Modification

`applyFeedbackById` delegates to `applyFeedback` after reading:
```typescript
const factData = await factReader.read({ factId, sessionId });
if (factData === null) throw new Error(...);
await applyFeedback({ factId, sessionId, event, currentTrust: factData.trust, correctionDelta }, { trustUpdater });
```

Keeps `applyFeedback` purely unit-testable; orchestration stays in `applyFeedbackById`. Consistent with "orchestrator over modifier" pattern.

#### Named Next RED Targets (M7)

| Name | Description | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| M7-A | null-fact error contract | High |
| M7-B | typed error narrowing (missing correctionDelta) | Medium |
| M7-C | FactReader contract test (real Crispin impl) | Medium |
| M7-D | applyFeedbackById user_correction path | Low |

### 2026-05-29: M4 RED — ClockProvider Seam Contract (Laura)

**Author:** Laura (Tester)
**Date:** 2026-05-29
**Beat:** M4 RED — ClockProvider injection for recency decay over real time
**Next owner:** Edgar owns M4 GREEN.

---

## Decision: ClockProvider Shape

**Chosen interface:**
```typescript
export interface ClockProvider {
  /** Returns current Unix timestamp in milliseconds. */
  now(): number;
}
```

**Location:** Defined in `packages/eureka/src/activities/recall.ts` alongside
`RecallDeps` (extraction to `packages/eureka/src/learning/properties/clock.ts`
deferred per §30 §2.4 note on FR-12).

**Citation:** §55 §1.2 — "Non-deterministic inputs (timestamps, random IDs)" →
mock at seam.

**Unit choice: milliseconds.**
The existing `compositeScore()` implementation divides by `86_400_000` (ms → days),
and all M2/M3 fixtures use `EPOCH_MS = 0` (clearly ms). Using ms keeps the interface
consistent with the live implementation.

---

## Decision: Required, Not Optional

`clock: ClockProvider` is **REQUIRED** in `RecallDeps`. No optional default.

**Rationale:** Defaults hide non-determinism. A `SystemClock` default would allow
the production smell (`Date.now()`) to silently persist in paths where the caller
forgets to inject a clock. Requiring the dep at the call site ensures every caller
is explicit about its time source. §55 §1.2 seam discipline.

---

## §-Tensions

### Tension 1: §30 §2.4 uses seconds; implementation uses milliseconds

§30 §2.4 specifies:
```typescript
class SystemClock implements ClockProvider {
  now(): number { return Date.now() / 1000; }  // seconds
}
function computeRecency(lastAccessed: number, clock: ClockProvider): number {
  const t = (clock.now() - lastAccessed) / 86400;  // seconds → days
}
```

But `recall.ts` currently uses:
```typescript
const tDays = (nowMs - fact.last_accessed) / 86_400_000;  // ms → days
```

And `last_accessed` fixtures use ms values (e.g., `EPOCH_MS = 0`, `BASE_MS =
1_000_000_000_000`).

**Resolution:** ms throughout — match the implementation. §30 §2.4 is pseudocode;
the implementation is concrete. Edgar should note this when implementing GREEN and
can flag to Crispin/Genesta if the spec needs updating.

### Tension 2: §30 §2.4 "optional default to SystemClock" vs §55 §1.2 required seam

§30 §2.4 says: "All time-dependent algorithms accept **optional** ClockProvider
parameter (defaults to SystemClock)."

§55 §1.2 says: Non-deterministic inputs → mock at seam. Defaults hide bugs.

**Resolution:** Required parameter wins. §55 §1.2 is the TDD discipline spine;
§30 §2.4 is the domain specification and its note about optional defaults is a
production-convenience suggestion, not a seam discipline rule. The two sections
have different concerns; when they conflict at the seam, §55 governs.

**Impact on Edgar's GREEN:** Edgar must also update the M2/M3 recall() calls in
production call sites (if any) to inject a real clock. Test call sites already
updated by this RED beat (option (a) — no optional default path).

### Tension 3: ≥0.18 margin rule vs recency-only max 0.108

The `unambiguous-ranking-fixtures` skill specifies ≥0.15 margin (task brief says
≥0.18) between adjacent ranks. With the FR-2 formula weights (recency weight=0.10),
the maximum achievable margin from recency variation alone is:
  `0.10 × (1.0 - 0.1) × 1.20 (hot) = 0.108`

**Resolution:** The ≥0.18/≥0.15 rule was designed for multi-dimensional fixtures
where near-tie scores could be swapped by floating-point noise. For a recency-
isolated test (identical relevance/importance/trust/tier, only clock differs), a
margin of 0.108 is fully unambiguous — there is zero floating-point ambiguity between
recency=1.0 and recency=0.1. The rule is relaxed to ≥0.10 for recency-isolated tests.
Skill updated with this clarification.

---

## M4 Fixture Summary

| Fact  | last_accessed           | tDays @ stub | recency | finalScore |
|-------|-------------------------|--------------|---------|------------|
| FRESH | `BASE_MS`               | 0            | 1.0     | **1.068**  |
| STALE | `BASE_MS − 100_DAYS_MS` | 100          | 0.1     | **0.960**  |

`BASE_MS = 1_000_000_000_000` (Sep 2001). Stub clock: `{ now: () => BASE_MS }`.

**Margin:** 0.108 (recency-isolated, unambiguous).

**RED failure (verbatim):**
```
FAIL  src/activities/__tests__/recall.test.ts > recall >
      ranks recently-accessed fact above stale fact when clock is pinned (§30 §2.4)

AssertionError: expected [ 'Stale accessed fact', …(1) ] to deeply equal [ 'Freshly accessed fact', …(1) ]
- Expected
+ Received
  [
-   "Freshly accessed fact",
    "Stale accessed fact",
+   "Freshly accessed fact",
  ]
```

Not a type/import error — an ordering assertion failure caused by production code
ignoring the injected clock and using `Date.now()` directly.

---

## M2/M3 Backwards Compatibility

Chose **option (a)**: update M2/M3 test call sites to inject a stub clock.

Added to both existing `recall()` calls in `recall.test.ts`:
```typescript
const FIXED_NOW_MS = 1_748_476_800_000; // 2026-05-29 00:00 UTC
const fixedClock = { now: () => FIXED_NOW_MS };
// ...
recall({ query, sessionId, k }, { factStore, clock: fixedClock })
```

**M3 score preservation:** FIXED_NOW_MS produces tDays≈20,237 for all facts with
`last_accessed=0` (EPOCH_MS) → (1+20237)^-0.5 ≈ 0.007 → floor 0.1. All M3 scores
unchanged (B=0.960, C=0.620, D=0.440, A=0.168).

**M2 correctness:** M2 facts have no `last_accessed` → tDays=0 fallback in impl →
recency=1.0 regardless of clock value. No ordering impact.

---

## Files Modified

- `packages/eureka/src/activities/recall.ts` — added `ClockProvider` interface;
  `RecallDeps.clock: ClockProvider` (required). Production still uses `Date.now()`
  — that's the RED smell Edgar fixes in GREEN.
- `packages/eureka/src/activities/__tests__/recall.test.ts` — M2/M3 clock injection
  + M4 test.

---

## Named M4 GREEN Owner

**Edgar owns M4 GREEN.**

Edgar's minimal implementation:
1. Import `ClockProvider` (already exported from `recall.ts`)
2. Change `const nowMs = Date.now();` → `const nowMs = deps.clock.now();` in `recall()`
3. No other changes needed (compositeScore already accepts nowMs as parameter)
4. Verify: M4 test passes; M2 + M3 still pass; build clean; Cairn/Forge baseline intact

---

### 2026-05-29: M4 GREEN — ClockProvider Seam Wired (Edgar)

**Author:** Edgar (Learning Systems Specialist)
**Date:** 2026-05-29
**Beat:** M4 GREEN — ClockProvider injection for recency decay over real time
**Predecessor:** M4 RED (laura-m4-clock-red.md)

---

## GREEN Landing

All 3 Eureka tests pass. Baseline intact.

**Verbatim output:**
```
 ✓ src/activities/__tests__/recall.test.ts (3 tests) 3ms
   ✓ recall > surfaces keyword-overlapping entries at ≥80% precision 1ms
   ✓ recall > ranks results by FR-2 composite formula descending (§30 §1.2) 1ms
   ✓ recall > ranks recently-accessed fact above stale fact when clock is pinned (§30 §2.4) 0ms

 Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  3 passed (3)
```

**Baseline (repo root `npm test`):**
- Cairn: 609 tests passed ✅
- Forge: 644 passed | 3 todo ✅
- Eureka: 3/3 ✅
- `npm run build` → `tsc --build` exit 0 ✅

---

## Implementation Shape

**Files changed (2):**

### `packages/eureka/src/activities/recall.ts`

`ClockProvider` interface and `clock: ClockProvider` (required) in `RecallDeps` were
already present from Laura's M4 RED. The only production change:

```diff
-  const { factStore } = deps;
+  const { factStore, clock } = deps;
   ...
-  const nowMs = Date.now();
+  const nowMs = clock.now();
```

`compositeScore(fact, nowMs)` was already parameterised — no other change needed.

### `packages/eureka/src/index.ts`

Added `ClockProvider` to barrel re-export:

```diff
-export type { RecallOptions, RecallDeps, RecallResult, FactStore } from './activities/recall.js';
+export type { RecallOptions, RecallDeps, RecallResult, FactStore, ClockProvider } from './activities/recall.js';
```

---

## No-Default-Clock Discipline (§55 §1.2)

`clock` is **REQUIRED** in `RecallDeps`. No `clock = systemClock` default.

**Rationale:** A default would allow the production smell (`Date.now()`) to silently
persist in any call site that omits the clock. Requiring injection ensures every caller
declares its time source explicitly. TypeScript enforces this at compile time.

**§-tension:** §30 §2.4 suggests "optional default to SystemClock". §55 §1.2 prohibits
defaults for non-deterministic inputs. **§55 governs at seam discipline boundary.** §30's
suggestion is production-convenience advice, not seam discipline.

---

## ClockProvider Location

Colocated with `RecallDeps` in `recall.ts` per Laura's contract.

Extraction to `packages/eureka/src/learning/properties/clock.ts` deferred per §30 §2.4
"pending FR-12 (extraction-ready design)". §55 §1.2 discipline: interface lives at the
seam, not in premature abstraction.

---

## §-Tensions

| Tension | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| §30 §2.4 `now()` returns seconds; impl uses ms | ms throughout (consistent with `86_400_000` divisor in `compositeScore`). §30 pseudocode is illustrative. |
| §30 §2.4 optional default vs §55 §1.2 required | §55 wins. Required dep at call site. Documented in laura-m4-clock-red.md. |

---

## Named M5 Target

**M5: Trust score updates from feedback events (§30 §2.3)**

§30 §2.3 specifies event-driven trust mutation:
- Corroboration: `trust = min(1.0, trust + 0.10)`
- Contradiction: `trust = max(0.0, trust - 0.10)`
- User correction: `trust = min(1.0, trust ± 0.30)`

Currently `recall()` consumes static trust from `FactStore.search()`. The cascade
demands a test that injects a feedback event and asserts the resulting trust mutation,
driving the trust-write seam into existence.

**Citation:** §30 §2.3 "Trust Dynamics Beyond the Static Floor"

**Laura owns M5 RED.**

### 2026-05-28: Team Norm — London-School TDD Ownership

**Date:** 2026-05-28T23:49:42Z
**Origin:** Aaron Kubly (via Scribe, coordinator mandate)
**Status:** NORM — durable team discipline

**Rule:** London-school TDD ownership:
- Tester owns ALL RED beats (failing tests that define contracts)
- Implementer agents own GREEN beats only (production code to satisfy contracts)
- Implementer may NAME next RED target but never claim ownership of writing the test

**First instance:** M1 RED (Laura) → M2 GREEN (Edgar) → M3 RED (Laura) → M3 GREEN (Edgar) → M4 TARGET named by Edgar (ClockProvider injection), M4 RED owned by Laura.

**Enforcement:** Git history verification, `.squad/agents/*/history.md` records ownership, Scribe calls out violations in orchestration logs.

---

### 2026-05-28: M3 RED — Composite-Ranker Ordering Contract

**Author:** Laura (Tester)
**Date:** 2026-05-28
**Status:** LANDED — RED
**Next owner:** Edgar (M3 GREEN)

New test added to `packages/eureka/src/activities/__tests__/recall.test.ts`:
```
✓ recall > surfaces keyword-overlapping entries at ≥80% precision  (M2 — still green)
✗ recall > ranks results by FR-2 composite formula descending (§30 §1.2)  (M3 — RED)
```

**Failure:** AssertionError ordering (storage order returned instead of FR-2 descending order). No type/import/config errors.

**Ranker seam decision:** Option (b) — Inline Scoring. Drive composite scoring inline in `recall()`. No new Ranker collaborator. (§55 §1.2, §55 §2.3 Key Lesson #3)

**Fixture design (FR-2 formula: rawScore = 0.50·relevance + 0.20·importance + 0.20·trust + 0.10·recency; finalScore = rawScore × attention_multiplier; multipliers: hot=1.20, warm=1.00, cold=0.80; recency = max(0.1, (1+t)^-0.5), t=days since last_accessed):**

| Fact | relevance | importance | trust | tier | finalScore |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------|------|-----------|
| A (Cold low-relevance)      | 0.2 | 0.2 | 0.3 | cold | 0.168 |
| B (Hot high-relevance)      | 0.9 | 0.8 | 0.9 | hot  | 0.960 |
| C (Warm medium-high)        | 0.7 | 0.6 | 0.7 | warm | 0.620 |
| D (Warm medium)             | 0.5 | 0.4 | 0.5 | warm | 0.440 |

Score margins unambiguous: B−C=0.340, C−D=0.180, D−A=0.272.

**What Edgar implements (M3 GREEN):**
1. Extend `RecallResult` with explicit fields: relevance, importance, last_accessed
2. Add composite scoring per §30 §1.2 formula (inline in recall())
3. Do NOT change trust floor (0.15) — M2 locked
4. Do NOT change call signature — M2 locked

**§-Tension (escalate to Aaron/Cassima):** §50 testability doc line 211 records `hot=1.0, warm=0.5, cold=0.1` (pre-v5 placeholders). Implementation must use §30 §1.2 canonical values (`hot=1.20, warm=1.00, cold=0.80`). §50 needs correction.

**Baseline:** tsc --build clean, Cairn 609 tests, Forge 644+3, Eureka 1 pass + 1 fail (correct).

---

### 2026-05-28: M3 GREEN — Composite-Ranker Ordering: Landing Record

**Author:** Edgar (Learning Systems Specialist)
**Date:** 2026-05-28
**Status:** LANDED — GREEN
**Next owner:** Laura owns M4 RED

Both tests passed after implementing FR-2 composite scoring inline in `recall()`.

**Baseline preserved:** Cairn 609, Forge 644+3, Eureka 2/2 ✅, tsc --build clean ✅

**Implementation shape (File: `packages/eureka/src/activities/recall.ts`):**

RecallResult extension: Added optional typed fields `relevance`, `importance`, `last_accessed` (preserve backward compat with M2 mocks).

Inline composite scorer (pure helper):
```
rawScore = 0.50·relevance + 0.20·importance + 0.20·trust + 0.10·recency
recency = max(0.1, (1+t)^-0.5) where t=days
multiplier = ATTENTION_MULTIPLIERS[fact.tier]
finalScore = rawScore × multiplier
```

Attention multipliers (§30 §1.2 canonical): hot=1.20, warm=1.00, cold=0.80

Pipeline: candidates → filter(trust≥0.15) → score → sort(desc) → slice(k) → return

Date.now() captured at entry; ready for ClockProvider injection M4.

**Ranker seam:** Option (b) confirmed — inline pure function, no new Ranker collaborator (per §55 §2.3).

**Recency derivation lock:** `last_accessed` is milliseconds (EPOCH_MS unit). Formula: `tDays = (nowMs - last_accessed) / 86_400_000`. All future tests must use millisecond unit.

**§-Tensions:**

1. **Tension 1 (Laura-flagged, confirmed):** §50 line 211 stale (pre-v5 values). §30 §1.2 is canonical. Crispin/Genesta should correct §50. Not Edgar's file.

2. **Tension 2 (new):** §30 §1.2 pseudocode references `CuratorStore.retrieve(sessionId, query)` but impl uses `FactStore.search()`. Equivalent seams; `FactStore` is current concrete interface. Future refactor may rename for alignment (deliberate rename, not bug fix).

**Named M4 TARGET:** recall (recency-sensitive ranking). Collaborator seam: `ClockProvider` (injectable `nowMs()` function per §30 §2.4). Assertion: fact with `last_accessed=yesterday` must outrank identical fact with `last_accessed=30 days ago`. Laura owns M4 RED.

**Post-work:** recall.ts composite scoring ✅, edgar/history.md appended ✅, london-school-green-beat/SKILL.md refined ✅

---

### 2026-05-28: M2 Decision Drop — recall() GREEN

**Author:** Edgar (Learning Systems Specialist)
**Status:** LANDED — GREEN

M2 London-school TDD beat complete. `recall()` is implemented and the AC-1.3 seed test passes.

**Test Result:** `packages/eureka/src/activities/__tests__/recall.test.ts` — 1/1 tests passed

**Baseline preserved:**
- `tsc --build` exit code 0 ✅
- Cairn: 26 test files, 609 tests ✅
- Forge: 24 test files, 644 passed | 3 todo ✅
- Eureka: 1 test file, 1 test ✅
- skillsmith-runtime + runtime-cli: all passing ✅

**Implementation (Locked at M2):**
- File: `packages/eureka/src/activities/recall.ts`
- Signature: `recall(options: RecallOptions, deps: RecallDeps): Promise<RecallResult[]>`
- Delegates to injected `factStore.search()` with trust floor (0.15) filtering
- Returns up to `k` results; composite ranker deferred to M3

**Named M3 Next-Red-Beat:**
- Activity: `recall()` ordering
- FR/AC: FR-2 (composite ranker formula)
- Requires: Ranker collaborator mock, ClockProvider for recency, sorted score validation

**Decision notes:** §30 pseudocode shows `new CuratorStore()` inside recall — violates London-school. Test contract (injected factStore) is authoritative. §30 pseudocode should update when M3 landsranker design.

### 2026-05-28: PR #26 — Copilot Review Doc Alignment (Cycle 1)

**Date:** 2026-05-28
**Author:** Cassima (PM — Eureka)
**Context:** Copilot automated review on PR #26 (eureka/v1-design-package branch merge)
**Status:** ✅ All 5 threads addressed

---

## Summary

Post-merge alignment sweep to fix 5 documentation inconsistencies flagged by Copilot's automated review. Substrate ownership was decided (ADR-0002 Option A monorepo, accepted 2026-05-27), but several committed docs still:
1. Referenced pre-decision state ("Four open decisions block...")
2. Cited gitignored `decision inbox drop ` paths (broken for other contributors/CI)
3. Claimed "pnpm workspaces, turborepo" when repo uses npm workspaces + `tsc --build`
4. Described user/project tiers as "stubbed" when PRD FR-7.2 says "NOT SHIPPED in v1 at all"

All edits were surgical — preserved doc structure, voice, and content except the specific inconsistencies.

---

## Changes Landed

### Thread 1: Executive Summary — Tier Scope & OQ-1 Status

**File:** `docs/eureka/technical-design.md` line 14

**Before:**
> three-tier storage (agent fully wired; user/project stubbed)
> Four open decisions block implementation — most critically, shared substrate ownership across the `mem/` and `harness/` repositories.

**After:**
> three-tier storage (agent tier only in v1; user/project tiers reserved in schema, adapters deferred to v1.5 per PRD FR-7.2)
> OQ-1 (substrate ownership) has been resolved via ADR-0002; remaining open decisions are tracked in the §00 ADR index.

**Rationale:** Aligns with PRD FR-7.2 canonical wording ("NOT SHIPPED in v1 at all, not even as NotImplementedError stubs"). Updates OQ-1 status to reflect accepted ADR-0002.

---

### Thread 2: References Section — Remove Gitignored Inbox Links

**File:** `docs/eureka/technical-design.md` lines 163-166

**Before:**
```markdown
- **Crucible Impact Analysis:** [`decision inbox drop cassima-crucible-eureka-impact.md`](...)
- **Substrate Blocker Memo:** [`decision inbox drop cassima-t7-shared-substrate-blocker.md`](...)
```

**After:**
```markdown
- **Crucible Impact Analysis:** See `.squad/decisions.md` § "Crucible ↔ Eureka Cross-Project Overlap" (2026-05-27)
- **Substrate Ownership:** See `.squad/decisions.md` § "Narrower Substrate Freeze Proposal" and ADR-0002 (2026-05-27)
```

**Rationale:** `decision inbox drop ` is gitignored (local-only working memos). Committed docs must reference content that resolves for all contributors. Merged substrate analysis now lives in `.squad/decisions.md` and ADR-0002.

---

### Thread 3: ADR-0002 Header — Remove Gitignored Tension Reference

**File:** `docs/eureka/adrs/0002-shared-substrate-ownership.md` line 8

**Before:**
```markdown
**Tension Reference:** §70 T7, `decision inbox drop cassima-t7-shared-substrate-blocker.md`
```

**After:**
```markdown
**Tension Reference:** §70 T7; merged substrate analysis in `.squad/decisions.md` "Narrower Substrate Freeze Proposal" (2026-05-27)
```

**Rationale:** Same as Thread 2 — replace gitignored inbox link with reference to merged location.

---

### Thread 4: ADR-0002 Toolchain Claims — Correct to npm Workspaces Reality

**Files:** `docs/eureka/adrs/0002-shared-substrate-ownership.md` lines 50-55, 138-145

**Before (Pros, line ~53):**
> TypeScript monorepo tooling is mature (pnpm workspaces, turborepo)

**After:**
> TypeScript monorepo tooling is mature (npm workspaces with `tsc --build` project references — already in use across `mem/`)

**Before (M0 prerequisites, lines ~140-142):**
> 2. **Monorepo scaffolding** (Roger + Gabriel) — pnpm workspace config, turborepo pipeline, unified `tsconfig` project references.
> 3. **CI/CD consolidation** — Single GitHub Actions workflow replacing per-repo CI. Turborepo `--filter` for incremental builds...

**After:**
> 2. **Monorepo scaffolding** (Roger + Gabriel) — npm workspace config (already present), unified `tsconfig` project references with `tsc --build`. Must complete before any package code moves.
> 3. **CI/CD consolidation** — Single GitHub Actions workflow replacing per-repo CI. Leverage `tsc --build` incremental compilation to mitigate whole-repo build time.
> ...
>
> *Note: Future migration to pnpm/turborepo could optimize build caching, but npm workspaces + `tsc --build` is sufficient for v1.*

**Rationale:** Repo reality check confirmed:
- Root `package.json` uses `"workspaces": [...]` (npm workspaces)
- `package-lock.json` exists (npm, not pnpm)
- Build command is `tsc --build` (TypeScript project references, not turborepo)

ADR claimed aspirational tooling rather than current state. Fixed to reflect what's actually in use. Added note that pnpm/turborepo is a possible future optimization, not a v1 requirement.

### Thread 5: Tier Status Table — Align with PRD FR-7.2 "NOT SHIPPED"

**File:** `docs/eureka/sections/00-overview.md` lines 242-246

**Before:**
| Tier | Path | v1 Status |
|------|------|-----------|
| User | ... | Stub (throws on write, empty on read) |
| Project | ... | Stub (throws on write, empty on read) |

**After:**
| Tier | Path | v1 Status |
|------|------|-----------|
| User | ... | Not shipped in v1 — schema reserved, adapter deferred to v1.5 |
| Project | ... | Not shipped in v1 — schema reserved, adapter deferred to v1.5 |

Also updated "Recall Fan-Out Strategy" prose to note multi-tier fan-out is v1.5+:
> 1. Sequential fan-out: agent → user → project (v1.5+)

**Rationale:** PRD FR-7.2 line 184 is canonical: "User and project storage adapters are **not shipped** in v1 at all (not even as NotImplementedError stubs)." Table previously said "Stub" which contradicts this. Fixed to match PRD wording exactly.

---

## Rule Extracted

**Committed docs must not cite paths under gitignored directories.**

- `decision inbox drop ` is gitignored → broken for other contributors and CI.
- References to decision content should point to:
  1. Merged content in `.squad/decisions.md` (cite section heading + date), OR
  2. Committed ADRs (`docs/eureka/adrs/*.md`), OR
  3. Committed PRD (`.squad/decisions/eureka-prd-v5-final.md`)

This rule is generalizable beyond Eureka — applies to any repo using gitignored working-memo directories.

Skill documented in `.squad/skills/doc-references-respect-gitignore/SKILL.md`.

---

## Verification

1. ✅ `technical-design.md` exec summary aligns with PRD FR-7.2 and ADR-0002 status
2. ✅ `technical-design.md` References section has no gitignored paths
3. ✅ `adrs/0002-shared-substrate-ownership.md` header has no gitignored paths
4. ✅ `adrs/0002-shared-substrate-ownership.md` toolchain claims match repo reality (npm workspaces, not pnpm/turborepo)
5. ✅ `sections/00-overview.md` tier table matches PRD FR-7.2 ("NOT SHIPPED", not "stubbed")

All edits were surgical. No unrelated content changed. Voice and structure preserved.

---

## Next Steps

None required. All 5 threads addressed. Skill extracted. Ready for next work.

---

## Cassima's Learning Notes

**What worked:**
- Surgical edits preserved doc structure and minimized churn.
- Copilot's automated review caught real alignment issues (not false positives).
- Rule "respect gitignore boundaries in committed docs" is simple, actionable, and prevents broken links for other contributors.

**What I learned:**
- Post-merge alignment sweeps are PM scope when they affect PRD/design consistency.
- Toolchain claims in ADRs should match repository evidence or be clearly labeled as "future migration."
- "Stubs" vs "not shipped" is a meaningful distinction — stubs imply user-visible surface, which contradicts PRD's scope deferral.

**What I'd change next time:**
- Could have proactively searched for other gitignored references during the sweep (did a grep after; none found).
- Could have verified `package.json` / `package-lock.json` existence before editing ADR-0002 (I inferred from charter context, but explicit check is better).

### 2026-05-28: Directive — DecisionRecord Naming Disambiguation

**By:** Aaron Kubly (via Copilot CLI)

**What:** Be explicit about which "Decision" concept is being referenced. If it's a Squad decision markdown artifact, call it a "Squad decision dotfile" (or "Squad decision memo"). If it's the runtime `@akubly/types` `DecisionRecord` interface, use the system-qualified name: "Cairn DecisionRecord" or "Forge DecisionRecord" depending on which system the record belongs to. Never use bare "DecisionRecord" in documentation when both could be meant.

**Why:** The Forge `DecisionRecord` TypeScript interface and Squad's `.squad/decisions/` workflow artifacts are conceptually different things; conflating them in docs creates ambiguity for readers and reviewers.

**Usage example:** When discussing the Forge runtime audit interface, write "Forge DecisionRecord." When discussing Squad markdown memos, write "Squad decision dotfile" or "Squad decision memo."

### 2026-05-27: Eureka v0.1 Technical Design — Assembled & Blocked on 4 Critical Decisions

**Status:** ✅ DESIGN ASSEMBLED — Implementation blocked
**Date:** 2026-05-27
**Initiated By:** Graham (Design Lead, Round 2 assembly) + Eureka team (Round 1 authorship)
**Urgency:** 4 blockers identified; OQ-1 (substrate ownership) is CRITICAL

**Summary:** Eight sections of Eureka v0.1 technical design are now drafted and assembled. All cross-section tensions have been surfaced, categorized, and either resolved or escalated as open questions. **Three critical blockers identified:**

1. **OQ-1 (CRITICAL — Cassima):** Shared substrate ownership — `@akubly/types`, `cairn/`, `forge/` duplicated in `mem/` and `harness/`. Three options: A=monorepo, B=submodule, C=npm packages. **ACTION REQUIRED: Aaron must choose A/B/C before sprint start.**

2. **OQ-2 (MEDIUM):** Event schema topology — Crucible's L1 WAL vs Cairn's event_log create dual-write trap. **ACTION REQUIRED: Pre-sprint-2 sync (Graham/Genesta/Roger) to lock event-substrate path (Option A=merge or B=federate).**

3. **OQ-3 (MEDIUM):** Decision/SessionId schema dual ownership — Crucible's Decision primitive vs Forge DecisionRecord vs Eureka DecisionPayload. **ACTION RECOMMENDED: Crucible rename Decision → ChoiceEvent for namespace clarity.**

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ PRD alignment: 100% acceptance criteria traced; 37/41 testable v1 (90% coverage)
- ✅ Milestone phasing: M0–M5 clear; M2/M3 can parallelize (sweep uses cadence, not session-end hooks)
- ✅ Crucible-Eureka overlap: Structural independence confirmed; safe to parallelize with storage fork directive
- ⚠️ Substrate ownership unresolved (affects Forge adapter; affects both Eureka + Crucible v1 implementation)
- ⚠️ Event schema collision identified (Crucible L1 WAL vs Cairn event_log; dual-write risk)

**Timeline:** OQ-1 decision needed THIS WEEK. OQ-2 resolved pre-sprint-2 (~3 weeks). OQ-3 resolved with Crucible team.

**Design artifacts:**
- `docs/eureka/technical-design.md` — canonical entry-point, v0.1 assembled
- 8 sections (§00–§70, ~198KB total content)
- 3 ADRs (0001, 0003, and proposed ADR 0002)
- 8 orchestration logs (`.squad/orchestration-log/2026-05-27T08-13-25Z-{agent}.md`)

### 2026-05-27: Friction-Level UX Decisions — Gated by v1 Dogfood Evidence

**Status:** ⏳ AWAITING EVIDENCE
**Date:** 2026-05-27
**Initiated By:** Valanice (UX Specialist)
**Urgency:** Four decisions gate v1.5 design; cannot lock until Aaron completes ≥10 dogfood sessions

**Four friction-level decisions deferred to v1.5 pending observed human behavior:**

1. **Commit Approval Frequency** — Current: ~1 approval/session. Evidence gate: `eureka_commit_invocations_total` counter. Threshold: If >10 commits/session OR rejection_rate <10%, flip to auto-approve with opt-in.

2. **Tier-Switching Observability** — Current: Silent (show "Searched: [tiers]" only if multi-tier results). Evidence gate: `eureka_recall_multi_tier_results_total` counter. Threshold: If >5% of queries ask "which tier?", show on every recall.

3. **Empty-State Actionability** — Current: Show suggestions ("Try a broader query"). Evidence gate: Log-based analysis (follow-up query rate, remediation success). Threshold: If remediation_success_rate >70%, keep suggestions; otherwise drop to factual-only.

4. **Contemplate Verbosity** — Current: Silent (v1 doesn't ship contemplate; v1.5 pending). Evidence gate: Post-contemplate confusion + summary action-upon rate. Threshold: If >10% ask "did Eureka run?", default to summary; otherwise silent.

**Evidence Collection Plan:** 10+ dogfood sessions (Aaron), telemetry counters, log-based metrics, post-session interviews (sessions 5 + 10). **Lock gate:** Cannot commit v1.5 friction decisions until dogfood evidence is analyzed.

**Instrumentation required:** Telemetry counters already in v1 scope. Interview protocol TBD.

**Signed:** Valanice (UX)

### 2026-05-27: Narrower Substrate Freeze Proposal — Accepted with Amendments

**Status:** ✅ EVALUATED — Recommendation: ACCEPT
**Date:** 2026-05-27
**Initiated By:** Erasmus (Crucible team, via Cassima)
**Evaluated By:** Genesta (Activities Lead)

**Proposal Summary:** Freeze only two cross-project contracts instead of full Cairn/Forge ownership:
1. `SessionId` brand + validator/constructor in `@akubly/types`
2. `DecisionRecord` shape and source union in Forge

**Genesta's Evaluation:** ✅ **ACCEPT with three amendments:**
- **A1 (Prescriber Opt-In):** Eureka-aware prescriber must be opt-in (explicitly registered), not default-wired into Forge.
- **A2 (SessionId Validation Freeze):** Include validation rules (UUID v4 format, parse/isValid constructors).
- **A3 (DecisionRecord Tolerance Contract):** Freeze adapter tolerance rules (forward/backward-compatible; breaking changes require 15-min sync).

**G4-Lite Governance:** CODEOWNERS for `@akubly/types` (both teams required), CHANGELOG for DecisionRecord changes, Slack handoff for breaking changes. No label automation needed (only 2 contracts vs full packages).

**Confidence:** HIGH. Narrower freeze covers all v1 contracts, reduces coordination overhead by 80-90% vs original scope.

**Next steps:** Graham configures CODEOWNERS (<10 min); SessionId brand lands this week (with validation rules per A2); DecisionRecord v0 frozen with tolerance contract (per A3).

**Signed:** Genesta (Eureka Lead), Cassima (PM)

### 2026-05-27: Crucible ↔ Eureka Cross-Project Overlap — Architectural Coordination Required

**Status:** ⏳ AWAITING AARON DECISION
**Date:** 2026-05-26
**Initiated By:** Cross-project overlap analysis (Genesta, Crispin, Edgar, Cassima)
**Urgency:** BLOCKER — both projects ship v1 in parallel

**Decision Needed:** Aaron must lock repository ownership, schema collision resolution, and prescriber/substrate wiring before Crucible sprint 2 and Eureka v1 implementation phase begin.

### 2026-05-27: Eureka TD Re-Pass After §55 — §20/§30/§40/§50 Aligned with London-TDD Spine

**Status:** ✅ AUDIT COMPLETE — Recommendations applied
**Date:** 2026-05-27
**Initiated By:** Aaron Kubly
**Question:** Should we do a TD re-pass after §55?
**Decision:** Full bounded pass (Option A) — parallel audits across §20/§30/§40/§50 + follow-up executions

**Summary:** Six-agent batch (Crispin/Roger/Laura/Edgar × 2 phases) verified that all four predecessor sections align with §55's London-school TDD mock contract discipline. All seams identified, all gaps addressed. No schema rewrites needed; seams are fundamentally sound with additive clarifications.

**Phase 1 — Audits & Executions:**

1. **Crispin (§20 Audit):** SEAMS HOLD — 5 findings, 1 interface addition (session_id to RecallQuery). No schema changes. **Deliverable:** `decision inbox drop crispin-20-seam-audit-vs-55.md`

2. **Roger (§40 DI Audit):** 80% injectable — 2 seams need extraction (`ClockProvider`, `RandomSource`), 1 correctly deferred (model). Forward-docs network boundary for v1.5. **Deliverable:** `decision inbox drop roger-40-di-seam-audit-vs-55.md`

3. **Laura (§50 Reframe):** §50 positioned as design-time testability discipline; §55 as implementation-time TDD practice. Complementary pair. **Deliverable:** Edited `docs/eureka/sections/50-testability.md` (+9%)

4. **Edgar (§30 Follow-Ups):** 3/3 executed — CuratorStore signature adopted, ClockProvider seam added, latency cross-refs established. **Deliverable:** `decision inbox drop edgar-30-followups-executed.md`, edited `docs/eureka/sections/30-learning-systems.md`

**Phase 2 — Recommendations Applied:**

5. **Crispin (§20 Apply):** §7.4 "Storage Seam (Mock Boundary)" added (names `FactStore` interface explicitly). RecallQuery updated. TDD notes added. **Deliverable:** Edited `docs/eureka/sections/20-knowledge-representation.md` (+12%)

6. **Roger (§40 Apply):** §40.5.4 "Time Injection" + §40.5.5 "RNG Injection (v1.5)" added. Network/model seams forward-documented. **Deliverable:** Edited `docs/eureka/sections/40-integration.md` (+19.8%)

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ All four sections now London-school-aligned with §55 spine
- ✅ I/O seams correctly identified; mock boundaries explicit
- ✅ Time/RNG injection patterns extracted (§30 + §40 coordinated)
- ✅ Phase 2 follow-ups landed without cross-section conflicts
- ✅ Zero implementation blockers; seams are fundamentally sound

**Learnings:**
- Parallel audits work well for cross-section stress-testing
- London-school TDD cascades to design docs (seams, boundaries, time injection)
- "Defer != ignore" — forward-document seams now, extract later (v1.5)
- Bidirectional cross-refs prevent §30–§55 latency-target drift

**Timeline:** Complete. §20/§30/§40/§50 ship-ready with full seam documentation verified.

**Session log:** `.squad/log/2026-05-27T15-30-00Z-td-repass-after-55.md`
**Orchestration logs:** 6 logs per agent (`.squad/orchestration-log/2026-05-27T*-{agent}.md`)

**Signed:** Scribe (orchestration logger), Crispin, Roger, Laura, Edgar

## Executive Summary

**Convergent Finding:** Crucible (v1-DRAFT) and Eureka (v5-final) both depend on shared substrate (Cairn, Forge, types) and both define overlapping session/decision/improvement semantics. The dependency direction is backwards: Crucible assumes Forge exists in `harness` repo but Forge actually lives in `mem` repo. The overlap is NOT accidental — Eureka is Crucible's future memory layer — but the shared-code surface is brittle without explicit coordination.

**Three critical blockers identified:**

1. **Undeclared Repository Dependency (BLOCKER — Cassima)** — Crucible cannot ship v1 without either duplicating Forge or depending on the `mem` repo. Neither is currently acknowledged in either PRD. Must resolve before sprint 2.

2. **Event Schema Collision (HIGH RISK — Genesta)** — Crucible's 5 primitives + L1 WAL vs Cairn's existing `event_log` creates dual-write trap. Must merge or federate before L1 substrate lands.

3. **Decision/SessionId Schema Dual Ownership (CRITICAL — Crispin, Genesta)** — Both PRDs mandate `SessionId` branded type + Decision schema overlap (Decision primitive ≠ DecisionRecord audit ≠ DecisionPayload learning). Requires namespace discipline + possible renames in Crucible.

**Two safe convergences identified (Edgar, Genesta):**

4. **Prescriber Pattern Convergence** — Crucible's Router mirrors Forge's existing prescriber family; can share substrate. Both teams should annotate convergence points.

5. **Learning-Loop Feedback Substrate** — Crucible's recorded sessions ARE Eureka's training data. Path 2 ingestion wiring enables productive relationship between self-improvement loops (not competitive).

---

## Three Strategic Questions for Aaron (Cassima)

**Q1: Which repo owns Cairn and Forge?**
- If `mem`: Crucible has undeclared dependency on this repo; merge or link must happen before Crucible ships.
- If `harness`: Eureka loses its substrate; Cairn must be forked/mirrored.
- If duplicated: drift is guaranteed.

**Recommendation:** Lock repository topology NOW. Genesta suggests Option A (merge Crucible into `mem` at v2 stage, maintaining federation boundary for isolated dogfood in `harness` repo).

**Q2: Is Eureka a v1 Crucible feature or separate v2+ integration?**
- Crucible promises "local-first sovereignty + record everything + self-improve" (§0).
- Eureka promises "durable, addressable, progressively disclosed knowledge" (§2).
- 80% mission overlap.

**Recommendation:** Clarify v1 scope. If Eureka is Crucible's built-in memory backend at v1, sequencing/dogfood changes. If separate v2+ integration, acknowledge delayed feedback substrate.

**Q3: Who gets Aaron's time when both projects hit the same blocker?**
- Both assume Aaron is sole dogfooder.
- Eureka v1 killer demos (US-1, US-2) require multi-session coding work.
- Crucible v1 success bar requires building v2 inside v1.
- Single-threaded resource bottleneck risk.

**Recommendation:** Sequence dogfood phases OR delegate one project's dogfood to external user.

---

## Technical Findings (Cross-Referenced)

### Finding 1: Repository Dependency (Cassima)
**Full analysis:** `decision inbox drop cassima-crucible-eureka-impact.md` §1.2 (undeclared dependency), §4 (resourcing)

- Crucible PRD §1 vocabulary, §2.4, §2.6, Appendix D assume Forge prescribers in `harness`.
- Actual location: `D:\git\mem\packages\forge`.
- Neither PRD acknowledges the cross-repo dependency.

**Recommendation:** Stagger projects OR establish explicit dependency + versioning contract.

### Finding 2: Event Schema Collision (Genesta)
**Full analysis:** `decision inbox drop genesta-crucible-eureka-overlap.md` § Finding 1 + 2 + 5

- Crucible §1: 5 typed events (Request, Artifact, Observation, Decision, Question)
- Cairn today: `event_log` with existing `eventType` vocabulary
- Eureka v5: Sessions are `kind=session` facts in Eureka's fact store
- **Dual-write trap:** Which is authoritative for replay?

**Recommendation Option A (Merge):** Crucible's 5 primitives become `eventType` values in Cairn's `event_log`. Crucible's "primitives" are typed façade over Cairn's polymorphic stream.

**Recommendation Option B (Federate):** Crucible ships in `harness` repo (separate). When merged to `stunning-adventure` at v2 stage, federation boundary explicit. Cairn observes Crucible sessions via MCP bridge.

**Gate:** Before Crucible sprint 2 (L1 substrate), convene Graham + Roger + Genesta to lock event-substrate topology.

### Finding 3: SessionId Brand + Decision Schema Collision (Crispin, Genesta)
**Full analysis:** `decision inbox drop crispin-crucible-kr-overlap.md` § 1 + 5, `genesta-...` § Finding 2

**Collision 1 — SessionId Brand (BLOCKER):**
- Eureka v5 (FR-13): `SessionId` branded type in `@akubly/types` (Aaron R8 directive).
- Crucible PRD: Implicitly assumes session identity but doesn't specify the type.
- **Both mandate the same brand; Crucible's requirements differ.**

**Recommendation:** Design `SessionId` for both Crucible + Eureka from day 1. Current design (UUID + validator) is sufficient for both.

**Collision 2 — "Decision" Naming (CRITICAL):**
- Crucible `Decision` primitive (§1): "any recorded choice by human or agent" — event-like primitive.
- Forge `DecisionRecord` (audit): Structured audit trail of agent decisions.
- Eureka `DecisionPayload` (fact): Contemplative structured deliberation with explicit options + rationale.
- Same word, three structurally different types.

**Recommendation (Crispin):** Crucible rename `Decision` → `ChoiceEvent` or `DecisionEvent`. ESLint ban on cross-system `Decision*` imports.

**Collision 3 — "Artifact" Semantic Drift (HIGH):**
- Crucible: "any reviewable content — inputs AND outputs" (PRD, patch, screenshot, transcript, upload, diff).
- Eureka: Informal usage only; "epistemological artifact" = learned memory representation.
- Risk at storage layer if both use content-addressed store.

**Recommendation (Crispin):** Crucible rename to `ContentBlob` / `CapturedContent`. Eureka avoid "artifact" in public types.

### Finding 4: Learning-Loop Feedback Substrate (Edgar)
**Full analysis:** `decision inbox drop edgar-crucible-learning-overlap.md` § 1–4

- **Crucible's loop:** Prescriber → Review-Gate → Apply/Inbox → Scorecard (minutes to hours per-session).
- **Eureka's loop:** Sweep → Ranker → Trust/Confidence mutations (hours to days across sessions).
- **Complementary, not redundant.** Different time horizons, different improvement targets.

**Judgment: CRUCIBLE IS EUREKA'S EVIDENCE GOLDMINE.**
- Crucible records everything — every decision, every alternative, every tool call, every file read.
- This is exactly the evidence Eureka needs for learning patterns.

**Current wiring (v5-final):** Path 2 ingestion exists but is on-demand only. Manual `eureka ingest-decisions --session <uuid>` after each session won't survive dogfood.

**Recommendation (Edgar):** Wire automatic ingestion before dogfood starts.

**Option 1 (Simplest):** Add Crucible post-session hook: `on_session_end → eureka ingest-decisions --session $SESSION_ID`. Opt-in via `.cruciblerc` flag.

**Option 2 (Event-driven):** Cairn already emits session-end events. Eureka sweep subscribes; on `session_end` (carries `session_id`), ingests Forge DecisionRecord stream. *v1.5 scope per current PRDs.*

**Option 3 (Prescriber ownership transition):** Forge prescribers move to Crucible; Eureka's extraction-ready design enables Crucible to eventually adopt learning kernel.

---

## Recommendations Summary

**Immediate (Pre-Implementation):**
1. Aaron locks repository ownership (mem vs harness vs federation).
2. Graham + Genesta + Roger design event-substrate topology (merge vs federate).
3. Crispin confirms Decision/Artifact renames in Crucible PRD v1.1-DRAFT.
4. Cassima sequences dogfood phases or delegates external user.

**v1 Blockers (Before Sprint 2):**
5. ESLint guardrail (already in Eureka v5-final FR-12 #8) extended to Decision/Artifact cross-system imports.
6. `SessionId` brand finalized in `@akubly/types` (ships v1, both projects).
7. Crucible L1 substrate locked to Cairn's `event_log` (Option A) or isolated to `harness` repo (Option B).

**v1 Opportunity (Nice-to-Have Before Dogfood):**
8. Crucible post-session hook wired for Eureka ingestion (Option 1, simplest).

**v1.5+ (Path D Kernel Extraction):**
9. Prescriber ownership transition (Forge → Crucible).
10. Sweep-trigger unification (Cairn session-end → Eureka sweep).
11. Confidence/trust branded types (orthogonality compiler-enforced).

## Closed Decisions

### 2026-05-26: Eureka PRD v5-final LOCKED — R8 4-Reviewer Lock-In Panel (Session Identity Unification)

**Status:** ✅ LOCKED (CANONICAL)
**Date:** 2026-05-26
**Locked By:** 4-reviewer panel (Graham Knight, Genesta, Crispin, Edgar) — unanimous LOCK, zero revisions
**Lock Status:** DO NOT EDIT — canonical specification; v4-final superseded

**Decision:** Eureka PRD v5-final is ratified as canonical, shippable specification after R8 post-lock amendment. Aaron R8 session-identity directive: Cairn `Session` and Eureka `kind=session` fact share one identifier (Copilot CLI session UUID) via shared `SessionId` brand in `@akubly/types`, with normative lens framing as guard. All R8 changes landed correctly. R8 design cycle CLOSED.

**What Was Locked:**
- **Artifact:** `.squad/decisions/eureka-prd-v5-final.md` (617 lines, 86.4 KB) — canonical stable location; supersedes v4-final
- **Lineage:** v4-final (R7, 555 lines) → v5-final (R8 amendments, +62 lines) — all R8 deltas annotated `[v5: <reason>]`
- **Panel:** Graham Knight (Architect), Genesta (Cognitive Systems), Crispin (Knowledge Representation), Edgar (Learning Systems) — unanimous verdict: LOCK

**R8 Amendment Scope (Judgment Calls + Enforcement Deltas):**

1. **Session Identity Unification:** Cairn `Session` and Eureka `kind=session` facts are the same entity (one CLI session UUID). Shared `SessionId` branded type in `@akubly/types`.
2. **Bridge Ledger Simplification:** `cairn_session_id_hint?` (optional) → `session_id: SessionId` (required). Eliminates nullable opaque correlation.
3. **FR-13 Amendment:** "Isolated by design" language deleted. Replaced with: "SessionId is shared; all other session attributes are system-specific. Lens framing (Cairn = lifecycle, Eureka = epistemology) is the normative guard against coupling drift."
4. **FR-7.2 Preserved:** No-cross-DB-ATTACH rule unchanged. Shared identifier is type-level only; runtime decoupling remains intact.
5. **§14a T-orphan Reframed:** "Dangling `cairn_session_id`" → "Stale `session_id` reference" (severity unchanged: LOW/LOW). Threat table entries in both §13 + §14a (belt-and-suspenders per JC1 disposition).
6. **FR-12 Mechanism #8 (NEW):** ESLint `no-restricted-imports` guardrail bans Cairn ↔ Eureka session-type imports except `SessionId` from `@akubly/types`.
7. **JC1 Disposition (T6 Row Placement):** Verified in both §13 + §14a threat tables.
8. **JC2 Disposition (v1 ship scope):** SessionId brand ships v1 (FR-12 #8); Trust/Confidence brands stay v1.5 (FR-12 #7).

**Reviewer Verdicts:**
- **Graham Knight (Architect):** LOCK — 8/8 enforcement items landed correctly; no new architectural concerns; v5-final surgical pass, no scope creep
- **Genesta (Cognitive Systems):** LOCK — all 5 guardrails from R8 fold verified (lens framing normative, neutral brand, no runtime traversal, ESLint boundary, Glossary updated)
- **Crispin (Knowledge Representation):** LOCK — all 6 spec items from R8 KR verdict verified (SessionId brand mechanics, kind=session schema, no identity collision, fact vs. filter clarity, edge schema tightening, session-fact integrity)
- **Edgar (Learning Systems):** LOCK — all 3 precision-gain items verified (sweep cadence v1.5 opportunity, `--session <uuid>` CLI v1 ship, AC-2.5 telemetry counter); zero new learning-systems risks

**Key Technical Deltas (Summary):**
- `@akubly/types/src/session.ts` (NEW): `SessionId` branded type + UUID validator + constructor
- `bridge_ledger.session_id` (NEW): `TEXT NOT NULL` replaces `cairn_session_id_hint? TEXT`
- FR-13 text: "isolated by design" deletion + shared brand framing + lens elevation to normative
- FR-7.2: no-ATTACH rule consistency pass + type-level-only clarification
- §14a: T-orphan reframe (same severity, clearer semantics)
- FR-12 mechanism #8: ESLint guardrail (ships v1)
- Glossary + §15: Lineage citations + Aaron R8 directive + Graham/Genesta/Crispin/Edgar verdicts

**Why This Approach:**
- Aaron's post-lock signal clarified operational reality: the session UUID IS shared; pretending otherwise was incidental complexity
- Shared `SessionId` brand documents ground truth without introducing runtime coupling (type-level construct, not runtime FK)
- Lens framing elevated to normative guard — "two systems, one entity" is the design principle, not apology
- Guardrails (ESLint + schema comments + ADR lock) prevent future coupling drift
- All R8 changes preserve R7 achievements (bidirectional adapter framework, confidence/trust orthogonality, 7-mechanism extraction-readiness)

**Artifacts:**
- **Canonical PRD:** `.squad/decisions/eureka-prd-v5-final.md` (stable location, do not edit; supersedes v4-final)
- **R8 Design Panel Verdicts:** `decision inbox drop graham-r8-session-identity.md`, `genesta-r8-session-identity.md`, `crispin-r8-session-identity.md`, `edgar-r8-session-identity.md` (all ACCEPT/FOLD verdicts)
- **Aaron R8 Directive:** `decision inbox drop copilot-directive-r8-session-identity.md`
- **R8 Lock Panel Verdicts:** `decision inbox drop graham-r8-lock-verdict.md`, `genesta-r8-lock-verdict.md`, `crispin-r8-lock-verdict.md`, `edgar-r8-lock-verdict.md` (all LOCK, unanimous)
- **Superseded Artifact:** `.squad/decisions/eureka-prd-v4-final.md` (historical reference; see header banner for migration note)

**Implementation Readiness:**
- v5-final is self-contained (no external doc required for implementation)
- All `[v5: <reason>]` + `[v4: <reason>]` annotations trace lineage back to R7/R5 origins
- No new architectural risks; all changes additive + simplifying
- R8 amendment window now closed; v5-final canonical until v1 implementation phase reveals needs for v1.1

**Next Phases:**

### 2026-05-30: WI-B PR #29 cycle 4 — prose redesign scope
**By:** Graham (Lead)
**Status:** Implemented in cycles 4-6

From decision inbox drop graham-wi-b-cycle4-redesign.md

**Thread analysis:** 51 unresolved threads across 4 files represent 5 distinct findings:
- F8a: Wrong-branch reuse calls git worktree remove without unlinking junction first
- F9: Backtick escapes inside cmd /c "..." are PowerShell-only; cmd.exe treats them as literals
- F10: {branch} resolved via git -C "{worktree}" AFTER worktree is removed — path doesn't exist

**Decision:** Replace all literal cmd /c "..." strings with prose instructions (tool semantically + platform-intent table). Prose conveys intent; literal shell strings invite mechanical copying of wrong form.

**Recommended form:**
- Windows: Use cmd /c rmdir to remove junction. Do NOT pass /s.
- Unix: m -f removes symlink only.

**Junction-unlink ordering (SAFETY-CRITICAL):**
1. Resolve the branch name: git -C "{worktree}" rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD → save as {branch}
2. Remove the
ode_modules junction/symlink (before git worktree remove)
3. Remove the worktree: git worktree remove "{worktree}"
4. Delete the branch: git branch -d {branch}

**Acceptance criteria:** 7 AC items verified — all backticks removed, F8/F9/F10 addressed, three-mirror sync locked.

### 2026-05-29: WI-B PR #29 review — APPROVE WITH NOTES
**By:** Graham (Lead)
**Status:** Reviewed and approved for merge

From decision inbox drop graham-wi-b-review-approve.md

**Scope adherence:** ✅ Gabriel implemented exactly what was scoped. Six change areas all map directly to concrete changes. No omissions.

**Activation semantics:** ✅ SQUAD_WORKTREES=1 correctly gated. Three-way branch (skip/worktree/disabled).

**Enforcement language:** ✅ Pre-Spawn now reads as imperative: MUST-level imperatives and ACTIVE status badge.

**Template sync:** ✅ Verified byte-identical across all three files (squad.agent.md + two templates).

**Fallback safety - ARCHITECTURE CALL (APPROVE with note):** Silent fallback to main repo on git worktree add failure. For v1 (opt-in, dogfooding), fallback is right default. Differentiated: lock-file errors get retry-then-abort; permissions/other errors get fallback. Already logged to history.md.

**Follow-up (not blocking):** Emit user-visible warning (e.g., "⚠️ Worktree creation failed — falling back to shared checkout") in addition to history.md log. File as follow-up issue.

**Branch-mismatch handling:** ✅ Safe. git worktree remove fails with dirty-tree error; git protects against silent destruction.

**Parallel dispatch warning:** ✅ Warning-only (detection via list_agents). Sufficient for v1.

**Risk #1 mitigation (file-deletion):** ✅ Two mechanisms — isolation + junction directionality.

### 2026-05-29: WI-B scope — Coordinator dispatch-policy
**By:** Graham (Lead)
**Status:** Scoping complete, implemented

From decision inbox drop graham-wi-b-scope.md

**Scope confirmation:** WI-B makes the coordinator CREATE worktrees per-issue instead of dispatching agents into shared main.

**Pre-Spawn discovery:** "Pre-Spawn: Worktree Setup" section (lines 697–742) was documentation-only. Gabriel's job: make it real.

**Concrete change list:**
- Pre-Spawn: Worktree Setup (enforce language + error handling)
- How to Spawn an Agent (resolve WORKTREE_PATH / WORKTREE_MODE placeholders)
- Worktree Lifecycle Management (reference docs)
- Template mirrors (must stay in sync)

**Opt-in vs default-on (Recommendation: Option A — Opt-in for v1):**
- Safety: Zero behavior change unless explicitly enabled
- Adoption friction: Users must know env var exists
- Complexity: Minimal — one if check
- Risk: Low — worst case is feature not used

**Dogfooding plan:**
- Worktree path: D:\git\stunning-adventure-{N}
- Branch: squad/{N}-coordinator-worktrees
- Env var: SQUAD_WORKTREES=1

**Risk flags:**
1. File-deletion mystery event during session — WI-B mitigates via isolation
2.
ode_modules re-install after worktree removal — cleanup flow handles junction removal BEFORE git worktree remove
3. Pre-Spawn is documentation-only — Gabriel added ACTIVE status + enforcement language
4. Parallel dispatch guard — warning-only recommended for v1
5. Template drift — Gabriel updates all three files atomically

## 2026-05-30: Squad Convention — Agent history.md Commits in Feature PRs Are In-Scope

**Date:** 2026-05-30
**Source:** PR #32 / issue #25, Cycle 1 Skeptic review (F3 flagged as scope creep)
**Decision:** Agent-maintained history.md entries in feature PRs are **IN-SCOPE**, not scope creep.

**Rationale:**
The `.gitattributes` file defines `merge=union` driver (line 3) specifically to enable parallel agent history tracking within feature branches. This is an intentional design pattern, not incidental coupling.

When `.gitattributes:3` declares `*.md merge=union`, it is explicitly authorizing commits that append to history files during feature development. Rejecting such commits as "scope creep" contradicts the declared merge strategy.

**Citation:** `.gitattributes:3` — "\\*.md merge=union"

**Scope boundary:** Agent history commits are IN-SCOPE when:
- They document agent work on the feature (not tangential or admin work)
- They follow the squad history.md format (one-liner, topic tag, date, agent)
- They do not alter code or test artifacts

Example in-scope entry:
```
- 2026-05-30 📌 alexander: JSON.parse boundary guarding via ProfileStalenessReason import
```

**Future:** If history bloat becomes a problem (file ≥15360 bytes), summarization rules apply (per Task 6). This is a hygiene gate, not a scope gate.

## 2026-05-30: Path A for Internal Helpers — Unexport and Shrink Test Surface

**Date:** 2026-05-30
**Source:** PR #32 / issue #25, Cycle 2, C2-3 polish
**Decision:** When an `@internal` JSDoc tag cannot be enforced (no api-extractor or stripInternal pass), prefer unexporting the helper and shrinking the unit test surface over maintaining a false-promise export.

**Rationale:**
The helper `normalizeProfileSource(payload: unknown)` was introduced in Cycle 1 to centralize JSON.parse payload narrowing. Tagged `@internal`, it was still exported for unit testing. This creates a false API promise — users can import and call it despite the intent to keep it internal.

Options:
- **(a) Unexport + shrink tests (chosen)** — Move coverage to integration tests. Helper becomes truly internal (scoped to module).
- **(b) Keep export + hope no one uses it** — Relies on convention; creates API risk.
- **(c) Use namespace/private pattern** — Language-specific; TypeScript has no true private exports.

**Choice:** Path A. The @internal tag already signals intent. Unexporting honors that intent and forces coverage dependency on integration tests (which are stronger anyway — they validate the full narrowing + validation flow, not the helper in isolation).

**Applied to:** `normalizeProfileSource()` in PR #32. Reduced unit test count from 28→26; integration tests retain coverage.

**Implication:** Team preference: explicit enforcement (unexport) > convention-based promises (@internal tag).

## 2026-05-30: JSON.parse Boundary Discipline — Unknown Typing + Runtime Validation + Drift Guard

**Date:** 2026-05-30
**Source:** PR #32 / issue #25, Cycle 1 F1 (Correctness) + Cycle 2 C2-1/C2-2 (verification)
**Decision:** When narrowing types that flow from `JSON.parse(eventLogPayload)`, enforce a three-tier boundary discipline:

### Tier 1: Type the payload as `unknown`
```typescript
const payload: unknown = JSON.parse(eventLogPayload);
```
Do NOT type it as `any` or the target type. This forces explicit narrowing.

### Tier 2: Validate at the boundary
Implement a helper (e.g., `normalizeProfileSource()`) that:
- Takes `unknown` input
- Validates shape (e.g., `if (typeof payload.source !== 'string')`)
- Returns the narrowed type or throws/returns null

Emit a **stderr warning** if coercion occurs (matching the pattern from `loadMetrics` in the codebase):
```typescript
if (payload.source && !VALID_PROFILE_SOURCES.includes(payload.source)) {
  console.warn(`[LoadedProfileSource] Coerced unexpected source: ${payload.source}`);
}
```

### Tier 3: Drift-guard the union
When the upstream union (e.g., `ProfileStalenessReason | 'FRESH' | 'STALE'`) grows, catch missing branches at compile time using a `satisfies` pattern:
```typescript
const driftGuard: Record<LoadedProfileSource | ProfileStalenessReason, true> = {
  'FRESH': true,
  'STALE': true,
  'UNKNOWN': true,
};
```
If a new reason is added and this helper is not updated, TypeScript will fail on the guard object (RED test).

**Citation:** Cycle 1 F1 raised that `JSON.parse` cast to `UnionType` was unguarded. Cycle 2 C2-1/C2-2 verified the drift-guard pattern resolves it.

**Impact:** Ensures JSON.parse payloads cannot silently accept malformed data or diverge from enum reality.

## 2026-05-30: PowerShell Here-String Convention — Use Single-Quoted @'...'@ for Code Content

**Date:** 2026-05-30
**Source:** PR #32 / issue #25, PR body rendering issues (2 occurrences)
**Decision:** When building multi-line file content in PowerShell that contains backticks (markdown code spans, `` `tsc ``, `` `null ``), use single-quoted here-strings `@'...'@` instead of double-quoted `@"..."@`.

**Rationale:**
PowerShell interprets escape sequences in double-quoted strings:
- `` `t `` → TAB character
- `` `n `` → newline
- `` `r `` → carriage return

Single-quoted here-strings treat backquotes literally.

**Problem encountered (2 instances):**
1. PR body description: `` `tsc `` became TAB + "sc", `` `n `` (in code block) became newline, eating the next line
2. Earlier in session: GraphQL multiline field values mangled the same way

**Pattern:**
```powershell
# ❌ WRONG — backticks interpreted
$content = @"
Run: `tsc --noEmit`
Type:
  - A (old)
  - B (new)
"@

# ✅ CORRECT — backticks literal
$content = @'
Run: `tsc --noEmit`
Type:
  - A (old)
  - B (new)
'@
```

**Applied to:** PR #32 body re-render in alexander-5. Prevents escape-sequence garble in future multiline content.

## 2026-05-30: Forge Roadmap Priority — Dogfood-First (Aaron Directive)

**Date:** 2026-05-30T23:55:00-07:00
**Author:** Aaron Kubly (via Copilot)
**Status:** ADOPTED

### What (1) — Eureka pace

"Let's not pull too hard on Eureka yet, it's still in the works." Defer aggressive forge → Eureka integration moves (the C2-1/C2-2/C2-3 Eureka-internal items Graham proposed) until Eureka stabilizes further. Forge can continue without depending on Eureka.

### What (2) — Next priority for forge

Packaging + installability + dogfooding is now priority #1. Forge's Phase 4.6 surface is implemented; the next move is getting it into a state where Aaron (and the team) can install + run it locally on real work to generate signal.

### What (3) — Compelling-but-deferred for forge

GP-tournament selection (Phase 5 §2.4) and Meta-optimization (DBOM on prescriber decisions, §3.5) are noted as compelling future moves, but explicitly *behind* packaging/dogfooding. They're soft-designed today and benefit from real dogfood signal before contract is nailed.

### Why

User direction on roadmap sequencing. Dogfooding-first reflects the principle that real usage signal beats further design speculation, and the deferred Eureka work prevents thrashing on a moving target.

### Implications

- **M0 (Alexander):** forge-mcp registration in plugin + copilot configs (shipped 2026-05-31 as PR #36, b22c8e7)
- **M1 (Roger):** Hint consumption MCP tools (cairn MCP expand recall hints → decision hints)
- **M2 (Gabriel):** Bash hooks + README (install forge-mcp, shell init integration)
- **Deferred:** Eureka FactStore adapter, forge→Eureka integration wiring (until Eureka v1 stabilizes)

## 2026-05-30: Forge Next Load-Bearing Move — SQLite FactStore Adapter (Graham Decision)

**Date:** 2026-05-30
**Author:** Graham (Architect)
**Status:** PROPOSED FOR FUTURE DISPATCH (deferred by Aaron dogfood priority)

### Context

Eureka v1 (`ef06238`, 2026-05-30) landed `recall` with a composite ranker and injectable `FactStore`/`ClockProvider` seams. The `FactStore` interface is well-defined (`search({ query, sessionId, limit, minTrust }): Promise<RecallResult[]>`), but no SQLite-backed implementation exists.

Forge's prescriber (`ForgePrescriberOrchestrator`) currently accepts an optional `ChangeVectorProvider` for historical context (statistical summaries). Eureka's `recall` would provide episodic context (trust-scored, recency-weighted facts) — complementary, not duplicative.

### Decision

**The next load-bearing move for forge is building the Eureka SQLite FactStore adapter.** Without it, `recall` is unreachable in production and the forge→Eureka integration loop cannot be validated.

**Sequence (when Eureka stabilizes):**
1. **Eureka SQLite FactStore adapter** — `packages/eureka/src/adapters/sqlite-fact-store.ts`, implements `FactStore.search()` against Eureka's SQLite DB. M, Edgar or Roger. This is Eureka's M5 milestone deliverable.
2. **Wire `recall` into `ForgePrescriberOrchestrator`** — add optional `factStore?: FactStore` alongside existing `provider?: ChangeVectorProvider`. Fail-open (recall failure → prescribe without episodic context). S-M, Alexander. Forge imports `FactStore` type from `@akubly/eureka` only (no impl coupling).
3. **`trustFloor` RecallOptions override** — small plumbing in `packages/eureka/src/activities/recall.ts`; seam already supports `minTrust` at FactStore boundary, just needs wiring. S, any agent.

### What to defer

- Eureka `commit` activity (v1.5+) — don't design before FactStore + recall wiring is proven.
- Issue #17 async-IO sweep implementation — Alexander's T3 closed the W5-5 gaps; issue should be closed, not implemented. `better-sqlite3` sync model is acceptable for single-user local tool.

### Risk

Schema lock-in for FactStore SQLite backing: trust/importance/attentionTier storage must be durable. Any migration later breaks cognitive memory. Design the schema defensively (nullable fields, enum TEXT columns with normalizeX guards matching the `normalizeProfileSource` pattern from PR #32).

### Current Status

Deferred per Aaron's dogfood-first priority (2026-05-30). Will be picked up after M0/M1/M2 complete and Eureka v1 stabilizes.

## 2026-05-31: Cycle-2 Latent Lint Bug Pattern — Windows `npm run lint` Glob Failure

**Date:** 2026-05-31
**Author:** Alexander (via Scribe, Issue #37)
**Status:** ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED; WORKAROUND DOCUMENTED; PERMANENT FIX TRACKED

### What

`npm run lint` fails on Windows with silent no-match (eslint glob `packages/*/src/` matches nothing via PowerShell glob expansion). Agents pushing code from Windows worktrees don't catch lint errors; Linux CI flags them post-merge. Example: commit 85d49b8 (PR #36 turn alexander-8) discovered unused-variable error during CI run, not local development.

### Root Cause

ESLint glob expansion via Node.js child_process on Windows uses native PowerShell glob rules (not sh glob rules). The pattern `packages/*/src/` expands to zero matches because PowerShell treats `*` literally when no files match at the top level. On Linux (`sh`), the glob expands correctly.

### Workaround

**UNTIL ISSUE #37 IS FIXED:** Agents modifying any package must use:
```bash
npm run lint --workspace=<package-name>
```

Examples:
```bash
npm run lint --workspace=forge
npm run lint --workspace=eureka
npm run lint --workspace=cairn
```

This bypasses the glob entirely and runs eslint directly on the package's source tree.

### Permanent Fix

**Tracked in Issue #37 (squad:gabriel):** Rewrite ESLint glob pattern or use a different linting approach:
- Option A: Use `packages/{cairn,forge,eureka,types}/**/*.ts` (explicit list)
- Option B: Run linter per-package in parallel (robust to glob expansion issues)
- Option C: Use ESLint's built-in workspace support (v8+)

### Team Discipline

Until fixed, Scribe will flag any `npm run lint` (bare, not `--workspace=...`) runs in orchestration logs as **ANTI-PATTERN** and agents are expected to use the per-package form.

### Follow-Up

Add CI check to detect `npm run lint` (bare) in agent logs and fail CI with helpful error message pointing to Issue #37 + workaround.

# M2 Design — forge-mcp bash hooks + install README

**Author:** Gabriel (Infrastructure)
**Date:** 2026-06-01
**Branch:** `squad/m2-forge-mcp-bash-hooks`

---

## Context

M2 ships bash shell init integration for forge-mcp so a user who clones the
repo can wire Cairn's session-start telemetry hook into their interactive bash
sessions. M0 (Alexander, PR #36) registered forge-mcp in the plugin and
`.copilot/mcp-config.json`. M1 (Roger, PR #40) added `list_optimization_hints`
and `resolve_optimization_hint`. M2 is pure infra: no MCP tool surface changes.

---

## Design Choices

### Hook script location — `.github/hooks/cairn/shell-init.sh`

**Options considered:**
- A. `.github/hooks/cairn/shell-init.sh` (parallel to curate.ps1 / record.ps1)
- B. `packages/skillsmith-runtime/scripts/shell-init.sh` (with the package)
- C. `bin` entry in skillsmith-runtime

**Chosen: A.** The existing PowerShell hooks (`curate.ps1`, `record.ps1`) live at
`.github/hooks/cairn/`. A bash counterpart belongs in the same directory. Users who
explore the hooks see all hook variants together. The package already has its own
concern (MCP server, sessionStart.ts); shell integration is a repo/infra concern.
The install script (`install.sh`) also lives here, completing the co-location pattern.

### Install mechanism — idempotent `~/.bashrc` append with marker block

The installer:
1. Checks `~/.bashrc` for the marker comment before appending (idempotent re-runs)
2. Appends a `source` line pointing to the absolute path of `shell-init.sh`
3. The marker is `# forge-mcp: shell init` — stable, unique, grep-safe

### Idempotency strategy — two-layer guard

Layer 1 (install script): grep for marker in `~/.bashrc` — skip if present.
Layer 2 (shell-init.sh): env var `_FORGE_MCP_SHELL_INIT_LOADED` — prevents
double-firing if the user sources the file multiple times in one session.

### Non-interactive safety

`shell-init.sh` opens with `[[ $- != *i* ]] && return` — a no-op in non-interactive
shells (scripts, CI, subshells). Safe to source unconditionally from `.bashrc`.

### sessionStart hook discovery order (mirrors curate.ps1)

1. User-deployed override: `~/.cairn/hook/sessionStart.mjs`
2. Global npm install: `npm root -g` → `@akubly/skillsmith-runtime/dist/hooks/sessionStart.js`
3. Repo checkout (sibling path from `.github/hooks/cairn/`):
   `$SCRIPT_DIR/../../../packages/skillsmith-runtime/dist/hooks/sessionStart.js`

The hook runs in the background (`node "$script" &>/dev/null &` + `disown`) so it
never blocks shell startup.

### Verification approach

A smoke test function `forge_mcp_check` is included in `shell-init.sh` and documented
in the README. It reports the discovered script path (or "not found") and the
installed version. Laura can run this after sourcing the file.

### Uninstall path

`uninstall.sh` (in the same directory) removes the marker block from `~/.bashrc`
using `sed` — no manual edits required. Idempotent: no-op if not installed.

### Zsh note

`shell-init.sh` uses `[[ ]]` and `function` syntax that works in zsh as well as
bash. Zsh compatibility is achievable by adding `source ~/.github/hooks/cairn/shell-init.sh`
to `~/.zshrc` in place of `~/.bashrc`. Documented in README as a brief note.

---

## Deliverables

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.github/hooks/cairn/shell-init.sh` | Sourceable bash hook (session-start trigger) |
| `.github/hooks/cairn/install.sh` | Idempotent `~/.bashrc` wiring script |
| `.github/hooks/cairn/uninstall.sh` | Removes the `~/.bashrc` marker block cleanly |
| `README.md` (new section) | Copy-pasteable install guide |
| `.squad/skills/forge-mcp-shell-install/SKILL.md` | Reusable shell-install pattern |

No changes to forge-mcp's tool surface, MCP wiring, or any TypeScript source.

# M2 Shipped — forge-mcp Bash Shell Init Hooks

**Author:** Gabriel (Infrastructure)

## What Shipped

| Deliverable | File | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Bash hook script | `.github/hooks/cairn/shell-init.sh` | ✅ |
| Install script | `.github/hooks/cairn/install.sh` | ✅ |
| Uninstall script | `.github/hooks/cairn/uninstall.sh` | ✅ |

| Tests clean | `npm test` — 49/49 | ✅ |

## Verification Recipe for Laura

```bash
# 1. Syntax check
bash -n .github/hooks/cairn/shell-init.sh
bash -n .github/hooks/cairn/install.sh
bash -n .github/hooks/cairn/uninstall.sh

# 2. Install (idempotent — run twice to confirm second run is no-op)
bash .github/hooks/cairn/install.sh
bash .github/hooks/cairn/install.sh   # should print "already installed"

# 3. Reload and smoke-check
source ~/.bashrc
forge_mcp_check

# 4. Uninstall
bash .github/hooks/cairn/uninstall.sh
source ~/.bashrc
# forge_mcp_check should no longer exist as a function

# 5. Re-install (confirm idempotency survived uninstall cycle)
bash .github/hooks/cairn/install.sh
source ~/.bashrc
forge_mcp_check
```

## Key design note

The marker block strategy (`# forge-mcp: shell init — start`) is the safe pattern
for managed rc-file entries. The install script will never double-append, and the
uninstall script removes the exact block. No manual editing required.

## F1-A: migration 018 — resolution_disposition column

Added `resolution_disposition TEXT CHECK (resolution_disposition IN ('resolved', 'dismissed')) NULL` to `optimization_hints` via migration 018. Schema version is now 18. `resolveOptimizationHint` writes `status='rejected'`, `resolution_disposition`, and `resolution_note` in a single atomic UPDATE. Existing rows are NULL (no backfill — system-generated data, not user disposition).

`list_optimization_hints`, `get_optimization_hint`, and the resolve tool all surface `resolution_disposition`.

`ResolveHintResult` and `OptimizationHintRow` types both carry the new field.

---

## F2: already-resolved response shape

When `alreadyResolved=true`, `resolveOptimizationHint` now returns `resolution: null` (the caller's intent was not acted on) and includes `prior_status` (the hint's actual state). The MCP handler response carries both fields so LLM consumers can correctly interpret "idempotent no-op" vs "accepted disposition."

---

## F10: get_optimization_hint surface shape

New MCP tool `get_optimization_hint(hint_id)` returns:

```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "skill_id": "...",
  "source": "prompt-optimizer|token-optimizer",
  "category": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "recommendation": "...",
  "impact_score": 0.0,
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "confidence_level": "high|medium|emerging",
  "status": "pending|...",
  "auto_apply_eligible": null,
  "parent_prescription_id": null,
  "evidence": {},
  "metric_snapshot": {},
  "generated_at": "ISO8601",
  "applied_at": null,
  "created_at": "ISO8601",
  "resolution_disposition": "resolved|dismissed|null",
  "resolution_note": "string|null"
}
```

Symmetric with `get_prescription`. Returns 404-style `{ error: "Hint '...' not found." }` when the id is unknown.

---

## Handler-layer testability pattern

Handler bodies extracted into exported pure functions:
- `buildListHintsResult(db, { status?, skill_id?, limit })`
- `buildResolveHintResult(db, { hint_id, resolution, note? })`
- `buildGetHintResult(db, { hint_id })`

Returns the raw JSON payload (not the MCP content wrapper). MCP handler calls the function and wraps in `{ content: [{ type: 'text', text: JSON.stringify(result) }] }`. Tests import directly from `server.ts` — safe because `if (isScript)` guard prevents server start on import.

---

## Test counts

- Before M1: 708
- After M1 (initial): 708
- After M1 cycle-1 fixes: **717** (9 new tests: 3 migration-018 schema, 3 handler `buildListHintsResult`, 3 `buildResolveHintResult`, 3 `buildGetHintResult` — grouped into 3 describe blocks × 3 tests each)

## New commit SHAs

- `4ca4542` — fix(cairn): M1 cycle-1 findings — migration 018, get_optimization_hint, F1-F13

### N1 (Medium) — Collapse migrations 017+018

**Done.** `017-hint-resolution-note.ts` now adds BOTH `resolution_note TEXT NULL` and `resolution_disposition TEXT CHECK(...)` in a single migration. Migration 018 file deleted. `schema.ts` updated (removed 018 import + array entry). Schema version stays at 17. All 4 test files with version assertions reverted from 18 → 17. `hintMcp.test.ts` migration schema section consolidated from two `describe` blocks into one that asserts both columns.

Idempotency: each column gets its own `if (!cols.some(...))` check instead of a single early-return, so the migration is safe to re-run against a DB that only has one of the two columns.

### N2 (Medium) — HINT_RESOLUTION_STATUSES dedup

**Done.** Exported `HINT_RESOLUTIONS = ['resolved', 'dismissed'] as const` from `optimizationHints.ts`. `HintResolution` type now derives from it: `typeof HINT_RESOLUTIONS[number]`. `server.ts` imports `HINT_RESOLUTIONS` and uses `z.enum(HINT_RESOLUTIONS)`. Local `HINT_RESOLUTION_STATUSES` constant removed.

### N3 (Minor) — Shared serializer to prevent list/get drift

**Done.** Extracted private `buildHintSummary(h)` helper in `server.ts` (above the exported builder functions). `buildListHintsResult` uses `hints.map(buildHintSummary)`. `buildGetHintResult` spreads `buildHintSummary(h)` and adds full-detail fields: `confidence`, `description`, `auto_apply_eligible`, `parent_prescription_id`, `evidence`, `metric_snapshot`, `generated_at`, `applied_at`.

Location: `packages/cairn/src/mcp/server.ts` — private `buildHintSummary()` ~40 lines above `buildListHintsResult`.

### N4 (Medium) — Follow-up issue for forge consumer

**Filed.** GitHub issue **#42**: "M3 follow-up: Wire forge prescriber to consume hint_state_transition resolution_disposition"
URL: https://github.com/akubly/stunning-adventure/issues/42
Label: `squad`

### N5 (Low) — Remove vacuous type cast

**Done.** `effectiveStatuses` in `buildListHintsResult` simplified from the `HintStatus[] | HintStatus | undefined` cast to `params.status ?? [...ACTIVE_HINT_STATUSES]`. TypeScript infers the correct union type; no explicit cast needed.

### N6 (Low) — Document confidence_level vs confidence asymmetry

**Done.** Chose option (a). One-line JSDoc on `buildHintSummary` documents that raw confidence float is omitted from the summary; callers should use `get_optimization_hint` for the float value.

## Test counts

| | Count |
|---|---|
| Before (cycle-1 baseline) | 717 |
| After (cycle-2 polish) | **716** |

Net -1: merged the two migration schema `it()` tests (one for 017, one for 018) into a single combined test for migration 017.
