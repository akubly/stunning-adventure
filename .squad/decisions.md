### 2026-05-29: M4 RED — ClockProvider Seam Contract (Laura)

**Author:** Laura (Tester)  
**Date:** 2026-05-29  
**Beat:** M4 RED — ClockProvider injection for recency decay over real time  
**Next owner:** Edgar owns M4 GREEN.

---

## Decision: ClockProvider Shape

**Chosen interface:**
```typescript
export interface ClockProvider {
  /** Returns current Unix timestamp in milliseconds. */
  now(): number;
}
```

**Location:** Defined in `packages/eureka/src/activities/recall.ts` alongside
`RecallDeps` (extraction to `packages/eureka/src/learning/properties/clock.ts`
deferred per §30 §2.4 note on FR-12).

**Citation:** §55 §1.2 — "Non-deterministic inputs (timestamps, random IDs)" →
mock at seam.

**Unit choice: milliseconds.**  
The existing `compositeScore()` implementation divides by `86_400_000` (ms → days),
and all M2/M3 fixtures use `EPOCH_MS = 0` (clearly ms). Using ms keeps the interface
consistent with the live implementation.

---

## Decision: Required, Not Optional

`clock: ClockProvider` is **REQUIRED** in `RecallDeps`. No optional default.

**Rationale:** Defaults hide non-determinism. A `SystemClock` default would allow
the production smell (`Date.now()`) to silently persist in paths where the caller
forgets to inject a clock. Requiring the dep at the call site ensures every caller
is explicit about its time source. §55 §1.2 seam discipline.

---

## §-Tensions

### Tension 1: §30 §2.4 uses seconds; implementation uses milliseconds

§30 §2.4 specifies:
```typescript
class SystemClock implements ClockProvider {
  now(): number { return Date.now() / 1000; }  // seconds
}
function computeRecency(lastAccessed: number, clock: ClockProvider): number {
  const t = (clock.now() - lastAccessed) / 86400;  // seconds → days
}
```

But `recall.ts` currently uses:
```typescript
const tDays = (nowMs - fact.last_accessed) / 86_400_000;  // ms → days
```

And `last_accessed` fixtures use ms values (e.g., `EPOCH_MS = 0`, `BASE_MS =
1_000_000_000_000`).

**Resolution:** ms throughout — match the implementation. §30 §2.4 is pseudocode;
the implementation is concrete. Edgar should note this when implementing GREEN and
can flag to Crispin/Genesta if the spec needs updating.

### Tension 2: §30 §2.4 "optional default to SystemClock" vs §55 §1.2 required seam

§30 §2.4 says: "All time-dependent algorithms accept **optional** ClockProvider
parameter (defaults to SystemClock)."

§55 §1.2 says: Non-deterministic inputs → mock at seam. Defaults hide bugs.

**Resolution:** Required parameter wins. §55 §1.2 is the TDD discipline spine;
§30 §2.4 is the domain specification and its note about optional defaults is a
production-convenience suggestion, not a seam discipline rule. The two sections
have different concerns; when they conflict at the seam, §55 governs.

**Impact on Edgar's GREEN:** Edgar must also update the M2/M3 recall() calls in
production call sites (if any) to inject a real clock. Test call sites already
updated by this RED beat (option (a) — no optional default path).

### Tension 3: ≥0.18 margin rule vs recency-only max 0.108

The `unambiguous-ranking-fixtures` skill specifies ≥0.15 margin (task brief says
≥0.18) between adjacent ranks. With the FR-2 formula weights (recency weight=0.10),
the maximum achievable margin from recency variation alone is:
  `0.10 × (1.0 - 0.1) × 1.20 (hot) = 0.108`

**Resolution:** The ≥0.18/≥0.15 rule was designed for multi-dimensional fixtures
where near-tie scores could be swapped by floating-point noise. For a recency-
isolated test (identical relevance/importance/trust/tier, only clock differs), a
margin of 0.108 is fully unambiguous — there is zero floating-point ambiguity between
recency=1.0 and recency=0.1. The rule is relaxed to ≥0.10 for recency-isolated tests.
Skill updated with this clarification.

---

## M4 Fixture Summary

| Fact  | last_accessed           | tDays @ stub | recency | finalScore |
|-------|-------------------------|--------------|---------|------------|
| FRESH | `BASE_MS`               | 0            | 1.0     | **1.068**  |
| STALE | `BASE_MS − 100_DAYS_MS` | 100          | 0.1     | **0.960**  |

`BASE_MS = 1_000_000_000_000` (Sep 2001). Stub clock: `{ now: () => BASE_MS }`.

**Margin:** 0.108 (recency-isolated, unambiguous).

**RED failure (verbatim):**
```
FAIL  src/activities/__tests__/recall.test.ts > recall >
      ranks recently-accessed fact above stale fact when clock is pinned (§30 §2.4)

AssertionError: expected [ 'Stale accessed fact', …(1) ] to deeply equal [ 'Freshly accessed fact', …(1) ]
- Expected
+ Received
  [
-   "Freshly accessed fact",
    "Stale accessed fact",
+   "Freshly accessed fact",
  ]
```

Not a type/import error — an ordering assertion failure caused by production code
ignoring the injected clock and using `Date.now()` directly.

---

## M2/M3 Backwards Compatibility

Chose **option (a)**: update M2/M3 test call sites to inject a stub clock.

Added to both existing `recall()` calls in `recall.test.ts`:
```typescript
const FIXED_NOW_MS = 1_748_476_800_000; // 2026-05-29 00:00 UTC
const fixedClock = { now: () => FIXED_NOW_MS };
// ...
recall({ query, sessionId, k }, { factStore, clock: fixedClock })
```

**M3 score preservation:** FIXED_NOW_MS produces tDays≈20,237 for all facts with
`last_accessed=0` (EPOCH_MS) → (1+20237)^-0.5 ≈ 0.007 → floor 0.1. All M3 scores
unchanged (B=0.960, C=0.620, D=0.440, A=0.168).

**M2 correctness:** M2 facts have no `last_accessed` → tDays=0 fallback in impl →
recency=1.0 regardless of clock value. No ordering impact.

---

## Files Modified

- `packages/eureka/src/activities/recall.ts` — added `ClockProvider` interface;
  `RecallDeps.clock: ClockProvider` (required). Production still uses `Date.now()`
  — that's the RED smell Edgar fixes in GREEN.
- `packages/eureka/src/activities/__tests__/recall.test.ts` — M2/M3 clock injection
  + M4 test.

---

## Named M4 GREEN Owner

**Edgar owns M4 GREEN.**

Edgar's minimal implementation:
1. Import `ClockProvider` (already exported from `recall.ts`)
2. Change `const nowMs = Date.now();` → `const nowMs = deps.clock.now();` in `recall()`
3. No other changes needed (compositeScore already accepts nowMs as parameter)
4. Verify: M4 test passes; M2 + M3 still pass; build clean; Cairn/Forge baseline intact

### 2026-05-29: M4 GREEN — ClockProvider Seam Wired (Edgar)

**Author:** Edgar (Learning Systems Specialist)  
**Date:** 2026-05-29  
**Beat:** M4 GREEN — ClockProvider injection for recency decay over real time  
**Predecessor:** M4 RED (laura-m4-clock-red.md)

---

## GREEN Landing

All 3 Eureka tests pass. Baseline intact.

**Verbatim output:**
```
 ✓ src/activities/__tests__/recall.test.ts (3 tests) 3ms
   ✓ recall > surfaces keyword-overlapping entries at ≥80% precision 1ms
   ✓ recall > ranks results by FR-2 composite formula descending (§30 §1.2) 1ms
   ✓ recall > ranks recently-accessed fact above stale fact when clock is pinned (§30 §2.4) 0ms

 Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  3 passed (3)
```

**Baseline (repo root `npm test`):**
- Cairn: 609 tests passed ✅
- Forge: 644 passed | 3 todo ✅
- Eureka: 3/3 ✅
- `npm run build` → `tsc --build` exit 0 ✅

---

## Implementation Shape

**Files changed (2):**

### `packages/eureka/src/activities/recall.ts`

`ClockProvider` interface and `clock: ClockProvider` (required) in `RecallDeps` were
already present from Laura's M4 RED. The only production change:

```diff
-  const { factStore } = deps;
+  const { factStore, clock } = deps;
   ...
-  const nowMs = Date.now();
+  const nowMs = clock.now();
```

`compositeScore(fact, nowMs)` was already parameterised — no other change needed.

### `packages/eureka/src/index.ts`

Added `ClockProvider` to barrel re-export:

```diff
-export type { RecallOptions, RecallDeps, RecallResult, FactStore } from './activities/recall.js';
+export type { RecallOptions, RecallDeps, RecallResult, FactStore, ClockProvider } from './activities/recall.js';
```

---

## No-Default-Clock Discipline (§55 §1.2)

`clock` is **REQUIRED** in `RecallDeps`. No `clock = systemClock` default.

**Rationale:** A default would allow the production smell (`Date.now()`) to silently
persist in any call site that omits the clock. Requiring injection ensures every caller
declares its time source explicitly. TypeScript enforces this at compile time.

**§-tension:** §30 §2.4 suggests "optional default to SystemClock". §55 §1.2 prohibits
defaults for non-deterministic inputs. **§55 governs at seam discipline boundary.** §30's
suggestion is production-convenience advice, not seam discipline.

---

## ClockProvider Location

Colocated with `RecallDeps` in `recall.ts` per Laura's contract.

Extraction to `packages/eureka/src/learning/properties/clock.ts` deferred per §30 §2.4
"pending FR-12 (extraction-ready design)". §55 §1.2 discipline: interface lives at the
seam, not in premature abstraction.

---

## §-Tensions

| Tension | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| §30 §2.4 `now()` returns seconds; impl uses ms | ms throughout (consistent with `86_400_000` divisor in `compositeScore`). §30 pseudocode is illustrative. |
| §30 §2.4 optional default vs §55 §1.2 required | §55 wins. Required dep at call site. Documented in laura-m4-clock-red.md. |

---

## Named M5 Target

**M5: Trust score updates from feedback events (§30 §2.3)**

§30 §2.3 specifies event-driven trust mutation:
- Corroboration: `trust = min(1.0, trust + 0.10)`
- Contradiction: `trust = max(0.0, trust - 0.10)`
- User correction: `trust = min(1.0, trust ± 0.30)`

Currently `recall()` consumes static trust from `FactStore.search()`. The cascade
demands a test that injects a feedback event and asserts the resulting trust mutation,
driving the trust-write seam into existence.

**Citation:** §30 §2.3 "Trust Dynamics Beyond the Static Floor"

**Laura owns M5 RED.**

### 2026-05-28: Team Norm — London-School TDD Ownership

**Date:** 2026-05-28T23:49:42Z  
**Origin:** Aaron Kubly (via Scribe, coordinator mandate)  
**Status:** NORM — durable team discipline

**Rule:** London-school TDD ownership:
- Tester owns ALL RED beats (failing tests that define contracts)
- Implementer agents own GREEN beats only (production code to satisfy contracts)
- Implementer may NAME next RED target but never claim ownership of writing the test

**First instance:** M1 RED (Laura) → M2 GREEN (Edgar) → M3 RED (Laura) → M3 GREEN (Edgar) → M4 TARGET named by Edgar (ClockProvider injection), M4 RED owned by Laura.

**Enforcement:** Git history verification, `.squad/agents/*/history.md` records ownership, Scribe calls out violations in orchestration logs.

---

### 2026-05-28: M3 RED — Composite-Ranker Ordering Contract

**Author:** Laura (Tester)  
**Date:** 2026-05-28  
**Status:** LANDED — RED  
**Next owner:** Edgar (M3 GREEN)

New test added to `packages/eureka/src/activities/__tests__/recall.test.ts`:
```
✓ recall > surfaces keyword-overlapping entries at ≥80% precision  (M2 — still green)
✗ recall > ranks results by FR-2 composite formula descending (§30 §1.2)  (M3 — RED)
```

**Failure:** AssertionError ordering (storage order returned instead of FR-2 descending order). No type/import/config errors.

**Ranker seam decision:** Option (b) — Inline Scoring. Drive composite scoring inline in `recall()`. No new Ranker collaborator. (§55 §1.2, §55 §2.3 Key Lesson #3)

**Fixture design (FR-2 formula: rawScore = 0.50·relevance + 0.20·importance + 0.20·trust + 0.10·recency; finalScore = rawScore × attention_multiplier; multipliers: hot=1.20, warm=1.00, cold=0.80; recency = max(0.1, (1+t)^-0.5), t=days since last_accessed):**

| Fact | relevance | importance | trust | tier | finalScore |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------|------|-----------|
| A (Cold low-relevance)      | 0.2 | 0.2 | 0.3 | cold | 0.168 |
| B (Hot high-relevance)      | 0.9 | 0.8 | 0.9 | hot  | 0.960 |
| C (Warm medium-high)        | 0.7 | 0.6 | 0.7 | warm | 0.620 |
| D (Warm medium)             | 0.5 | 0.4 | 0.5 | warm | 0.440 |

Score margins unambiguous: B−C=0.340, C−D=0.180, D−A=0.272.

**What Edgar implements (M3 GREEN):**
1. Extend `RecallResult` with explicit fields: relevance, importance, last_accessed
2. Add composite scoring per §30 §1.2 formula (inline in recall())
3. Do NOT change trust floor (0.15) — M2 locked
4. Do NOT change call signature — M2 locked

**§-Tension (escalate to Aaron/Cassima):** §50 testability doc line 211 records `hot=1.0, warm=0.5, cold=0.1` (pre-v5 placeholders). Implementation must use §30 §1.2 canonical values (`hot=1.20, warm=1.00, cold=0.80`). §50 needs correction.

**Baseline:** tsc --build clean, Cairn 609 tests, Forge 644+3, Eureka 1 pass + 1 fail (correct).

---

### 2026-05-28: M3 GREEN — Composite-Ranker Ordering: Landing Record

**Author:** Edgar (Learning Systems Specialist)  
**Date:** 2026-05-28  
**Status:** LANDED — GREEN  
**Next owner:** Laura owns M4 RED

Both tests passed after implementing FR-2 composite scoring inline in `recall()`.

**Baseline preserved:** Cairn 609, Forge 644+3, Eureka 2/2 ✅, tsc --build clean ✅

**Implementation shape (File: `packages/eureka/src/activities/recall.ts`):**

RecallResult extension: Added optional typed fields `relevance`, `importance`, `last_accessed` (preserve backward compat with M2 mocks).

Inline composite scorer (pure helper): 
```
rawScore = 0.50·relevance + 0.20·importance + 0.20·trust + 0.10·recency
recency = max(0.1, (1+t)^-0.5) where t=days
multiplier = ATTENTION_MULTIPLIERS[fact.tier]
finalScore = rawScore × multiplier
```

Attention multipliers (§30 §1.2 canonical): hot=1.20, warm=1.00, cold=0.80

Pipeline: candidates → filter(trust≥0.15) → score → sort(desc) → slice(k) → return

Date.now() captured at entry; ready for ClockProvider injection M4.

**Ranker seam:** Option (b) confirmed — inline pure function, no new Ranker collaborator (per §55 §2.3).

**Recency derivation lock:** `last_accessed` is milliseconds (EPOCH_MS unit). Formula: `tDays = (nowMs - last_accessed) / 86_400_000`. All future tests must use millisecond unit.

**§-Tensions:**

1. **Tension 1 (Laura-flagged, confirmed):** §50 line 211 stale (pre-v5 values). §30 §1.2 is canonical. Crispin/Genesta should correct §50. Not Edgar's file.

2. **Tension 2 (new):** §30 §1.2 pseudocode references `CuratorStore.retrieve(sessionId, query)` but impl uses `FactStore.search()`. Equivalent seams; `FactStore` is current concrete interface. Future refactor may rename for alignment (deliberate rename, not bug fix).

**Named M4 TARGET:** recall (recency-sensitive ranking). Collaborator seam: `ClockProvider` (injectable `nowMs()` function per §30 §2.4). Assertion: fact with `last_accessed=yesterday` must outrank identical fact with `last_accessed=30 days ago`. Laura owns M4 RED.

**Post-work:** recall.ts composite scoring ✅, edgar/history.md appended ✅, london-school-green-beat/SKILL.md refined ✅

---

### 2026-05-28: M2 Decision Drop — recall() GREEN

**Author:** Edgar (Learning Systems Specialist)  
**Status:** LANDED — GREEN

M2 London-school TDD beat complete. `recall()` is implemented and the AC-1.3 seed test passes.

**Test Result:** `packages/eureka/src/activities/__tests__/recall.test.ts` — 1/1 tests passed

**Baseline preserved:**
- `tsc --build` exit code 0 ✅
- Cairn: 26 test files, 609 tests ✅
- Forge: 24 test files, 644 passed | 3 todo ✅
- Eureka: 1 test file, 1 test ✅
- skillsmith-runtime + runtime-cli: all passing ✅

**Implementation (Locked at M2):**
- File: `packages/eureka/src/activities/recall.ts`
- Signature: `recall(options: RecallOptions, deps: RecallDeps): Promise<RecallResult[]>`
- Delegates to injected `factStore.search()` with trust floor (0.15) filtering
- Returns up to `k` results; composite ranker deferred to M3

**Named M3 Next-Red-Beat:**
- Activity: `recall()` ordering
- FR/AC: FR-2 (composite ranker formula)
- Requires: Ranker collaborator mock, ClockProvider for recency, sorted score validation

**Decision notes:** §30 pseudocode shows `new CuratorStore()` inside recall — violates London-school. Test contract (injected factStore) is authoritative. §30 pseudocode should update when M3 landsranker design.

### 2026-05-28: PR #26 — Copilot Review Doc Alignment (Cycle 1)

**Date:** 2026-05-28  
**Author:** Cassima (PM — Eureka)  
**Context:** Copilot automated review on PR #26 (eureka/v1-design-package branch merge)  
**Status:** ✅ All 5 threads addressed

---

## Summary

Post-merge alignment sweep to fix 5 documentation inconsistencies flagged by Copilot's automated review. Substrate ownership was decided (ADR-0002 Option A monorepo, accepted 2026-05-27), but several committed docs still:
1. Referenced pre-decision state ("Four open decisions block...")
2. Cited gitignored `.squad/decisions/inbox/` paths (broken for other contributors/CI)
3. Claimed "pnpm workspaces, turborepo" when repo uses npm workspaces + `tsc --build`
4. Described user/project tiers as "stubbed" when PRD FR-7.2 says "NOT SHIPPED in v1 at all"

All edits were surgical — preserved doc structure, voice, and content except the specific inconsistencies.

---

## Changes Landed

### Thread 1: Executive Summary — Tier Scope & OQ-1 Status

**File:** `docs/eureka/technical-design.md` line 14

**Before:**
> three-tier storage (agent fully wired; user/project stubbed)
> Four open decisions block implementation — most critically, shared substrate ownership across the `mem/` and `harness/` repositories.

**After:**
> three-tier storage (agent tier only in v1; user/project tiers reserved in schema, adapters deferred to v1.5 per PRD FR-7.2)
> OQ-1 (substrate ownership) has been resolved via ADR-0002; remaining open decisions are tracked in the §00 ADR index.

**Rationale:** Aligns with PRD FR-7.2 canonical wording ("NOT SHIPPED in v1 at all, not even as NotImplementedError stubs"). Updates OQ-1 status to reflect accepted ADR-0002.

---

### Thread 2: References Section — Remove Gitignored Inbox Links

**File:** `docs/eureka/technical-design.md` lines 163-166

**Before:**
```markdown
- **Crucible Impact Analysis:** [`.squad/decisions/inbox/cassima-crucible-eureka-impact.md`](...)
- **Substrate Blocker Memo:** [`.squad/decisions/inbox/cassima-t7-shared-substrate-blocker.md`](...)
```

**After:**
```markdown
- **Crucible Impact Analysis:** See `.squad/decisions.md` § "Crucible ↔ Eureka Cross-Project Overlap" (2026-05-27)
- **Substrate Ownership:** See `.squad/decisions.md` § "Narrower Substrate Freeze Proposal" and ADR-0002 (2026-05-27)
```

**Rationale:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/` is gitignored (local-only working memos). Committed docs must reference content that resolves for all contributors. Merged substrate analysis now lives in `.squad/decisions.md` and ADR-0002.

---

### Thread 3: ADR-0002 Header — Remove Gitignored Tension Reference

**File:** `docs/eureka/adrs/0002-shared-substrate-ownership.md` line 8

**Before:**
```markdown
**Tension Reference:** §70 T7, `.squad/decisions/inbox/cassima-t7-shared-substrate-blocker.md`
```

**After:**
```markdown
**Tension Reference:** §70 T7; merged substrate analysis in `.squad/decisions.md` "Narrower Substrate Freeze Proposal" (2026-05-27)
```

**Rationale:** Same as Thread 2 — replace gitignored inbox link with reference to merged location.

---

### Thread 4: ADR-0002 Toolchain Claims — Correct to npm Workspaces Reality

**Files:** `docs/eureka/adrs/0002-shared-substrate-ownership.md` lines 50-55, 138-145

**Before (Pros, line ~53):**
> TypeScript monorepo tooling is mature (pnpm workspaces, turborepo)

**After:**
> TypeScript monorepo tooling is mature (npm workspaces with `tsc --build` project references — already in use across `mem/`)

**Before (M0 prerequisites, lines ~140-142):**
> 2. **Monorepo scaffolding** (Roger + Gabriel) — pnpm workspace config, turborepo pipeline, unified `tsconfig` project references.
> 3. **CI/CD consolidation** — Single GitHub Actions workflow replacing per-repo CI. Turborepo `--filter` for incremental builds...

**After:**
> 2. **Monorepo scaffolding** (Roger + Gabriel) — npm workspace config (already present), unified `tsconfig` project references with `tsc --build`. Must complete before any package code moves.
> 3. **CI/CD consolidation** — Single GitHub Actions workflow replacing per-repo CI. Leverage `tsc --build` incremental compilation to mitigate whole-repo build time.
> ...
> 
> *Note: Future migration to pnpm/turborepo could optimize build caching, but npm workspaces + `tsc --build` is sufficient for v1.*

**Rationale:** Repo reality check confirmed:
- Root `package.json` uses `"workspaces": [...]` (npm workspaces)
- `package-lock.json` exists (npm, not pnpm)
- Build command is `tsc --build` (TypeScript project references, not turborepo)

ADR claimed aspirational tooling rather than current state. Fixed to reflect what's actually in use. Added note that pnpm/turborepo is a possible future optimization, not a v1 requirement.

---

### Thread 5: Tier Status Table — Align with PRD FR-7.2 "NOT SHIPPED"

**File:** `docs/eureka/sections/00-overview.md` lines 242-246

**Before:**
| Tier | Path | v1 Status |
|------|------|-----------|
| User | ... | Stub (throws on write, empty on read) |
| Project | ... | Stub (throws on write, empty on read) |

**After:**
| Tier | Path | v1 Status |
|------|------|-----------|
| User | ... | Not shipped in v1 — schema reserved, adapter deferred to v1.5 |
| Project | ... | Not shipped in v1 — schema reserved, adapter deferred to v1.5 |

Also updated "Recall Fan-Out Strategy" prose to note multi-tier fan-out is v1.5+:
> 1. Sequential fan-out: agent → user → project (v1.5+)

**Rationale:** PRD FR-7.2 line 184 is canonical: "User and project storage adapters are **not shipped** in v1 at all (not even as NotImplementedError stubs)." Table previously said "Stub" which contradicts this. Fixed to match PRD wording exactly.

---

## Rule Extracted

**Committed docs must not cite paths under gitignored directories.**

- `.squad/decisions/inbox/` is gitignored → broken for other contributors and CI.
- References to decision content should point to:
  1. Merged content in `.squad/decisions.md` (cite section heading + date), OR
  2. Committed ADRs (`docs/eureka/adrs/*.md`), OR
  3. Committed PRD (`.squad/decisions/eureka-prd-v5-final.md`)

This rule is generalizable beyond Eureka — applies to any repo using gitignored working-memo directories.

Skill documented in `.squad/skills/doc-references-respect-gitignore/SKILL.md`.

---

## Verification

1. ✅ `technical-design.md` exec summary aligns with PRD FR-7.2 and ADR-0002 status
2. ✅ `technical-design.md` References section has no gitignored paths
3. ✅ `adrs/0002-shared-substrate-ownership.md` header has no gitignored paths
4. ✅ `adrs/0002-shared-substrate-ownership.md` toolchain claims match repo reality (npm workspaces, not pnpm/turborepo)
5. ✅ `sections/00-overview.md` tier table matches PRD FR-7.2 ("NOT SHIPPED", not "stubbed")

All edits were surgical. No unrelated content changed. Voice and structure preserved.

---

## Next Steps

None required. All 5 threads addressed. Skill extracted. Ready for next work.

---

## Cassima's Learning Notes

**What worked:**
- Surgical edits preserved doc structure and minimized churn.
- Copilot's automated review caught real alignment issues (not false positives).
- Rule "respect gitignore boundaries in committed docs" is simple, actionable, and prevents broken links for other contributors.

**What I learned:**
- Post-merge alignment sweeps are PM scope when they affect PRD/design consistency.
- Toolchain claims in ADRs should match repository evidence or be clearly labeled as "future migration."
- "Stubs" vs "not shipped" is a meaningful distinction — stubs imply user-visible surface, which contradicts PRD's scope deferral.

**What I'd change next time:**
- Could have proactively searched for other gitignored references during the sweep (did a grep after; none found).
- Could have verified `package.json` / `package-lock.json` existence before editing ADR-0002 (I inferred from charter context, but explicit check is better).

### 2026-05-28: Directive — DecisionRecord Naming Disambiguation

**By:** Aaron Kubly (via Copilot CLI)

**What:** Be explicit about which "Decision" concept is being referenced. If it's a Squad decision markdown artifact, call it a "Squad decision dotfile" (or "Squad decision memo"). If it's the runtime `@akubly/types` `DecisionRecord` interface, use the system-qualified name: "Cairn DecisionRecord" or "Forge DecisionRecord" depending on which system the record belongs to. Never use bare "DecisionRecord" in documentation when both could be meant.

**Why:** The Forge `DecisionRecord` TypeScript interface and Squad's `.squad/decisions/` workflow artifacts are conceptually different things; conflating them in docs creates ambiguity for readers and reviewers.

**Usage example:** When discussing the Forge runtime audit interface, write "Forge DecisionRecord." When discussing Squad markdown memos, write "Squad decision dotfile" or "Squad decision memo."

### 2026-05-27: Eureka v0.1 Technical Design — Assembled & Blocked on 4 Critical Decisions

**Status:** ✅ DESIGN ASSEMBLED — Implementation blocked  
**Date:** 2026-05-27  
**Initiated By:** Graham (Design Lead, Round 2 assembly) + Eureka team (Round 1 authorship)  
**Urgency:** 4 blockers identified; OQ-1 (substrate ownership) is CRITICAL

**Summary:** Eight sections of Eureka v0.1 technical design are now drafted and assembled. All cross-section tensions have been surfaced, categorized, and either resolved or escalated as open questions. **Three critical blockers identified:**

1. **OQ-1 (CRITICAL — Cassima):** Shared substrate ownership — `@akubly/types`, `cairn/`, `forge/` duplicated in `mem/` and `harness/`. Three options: A=monorepo, B=submodule, C=npm packages. **ACTION REQUIRED: Aaron must choose A/B/C before sprint start.**

2. **OQ-2 (MEDIUM):** Event schema topology — Crucible's L1 WAL vs Cairn's event_log create dual-write trap. **ACTION REQUIRED: Pre-sprint-2 sync (Graham/Genesta/Roger) to lock event-substrate path (Option A=merge or B=federate).**

3. **OQ-3 (MEDIUM):** Decision/SessionId schema dual ownership — Crucible's Decision primitive vs Forge DecisionRecord vs Eureka DecisionPayload. **ACTION RECOMMENDED: Crucible rename Decision → ChoiceEvent for namespace clarity.**

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ PRD alignment: 100% acceptance criteria traced; 37/41 testable v1 (90% coverage)
- ✅ Milestone phasing: M0–M5 clear; M2/M3 can parallelize (sweep uses cadence, not session-end hooks)
- ✅ Crucible-Eureka overlap: Structural independence confirmed; safe to parallelize with storage fork directive
- ⚠️ Substrate ownership unresolved (affects Forge adapter; affects both Eureka + Crucible v1 implementation)
- ⚠️ Event schema collision identified (Crucible L1 WAL vs Cairn event_log; dual-write risk)

**Timeline:** OQ-1 decision needed THIS WEEK. OQ-2 resolved pre-sprint-2 (~3 weeks). OQ-3 resolved with Crucible team.

**Design artifacts:** 
- `docs/eureka/technical-design.md` — canonical entry-point, v0.1 assembled
- 8 sections (§00–§70, ~198KB total content)
- 3 ADRs (0001, 0003, and proposed ADR 0002)
- 8 orchestration logs (`.squad/orchestration-log/2026-05-27T08-13-25Z-{agent}.md`)

### 2026-05-27: Friction-Level UX Decisions — Gated by v1 Dogfood Evidence

**Status:** ⏳ AWAITING EVIDENCE  
**Date:** 2026-05-27  
**Initiated By:** Valanice (UX Specialist)  
**Urgency:** Four decisions gate v1.5 design; cannot lock until Aaron completes ≥10 dogfood sessions

**Four friction-level decisions deferred to v1.5 pending observed human behavior:**

1. **Commit Approval Frequency** — Current: ~1 approval/session. Evidence gate: `eureka_commit_invocations_total` counter. Threshold: If >10 commits/session OR rejection_rate <10%, flip to auto-approve with opt-in.

2. **Tier-Switching Observability** — Current: Silent (show "Searched: [tiers]" only if multi-tier results). Evidence gate: `eureka_recall_multi_tier_results_total` counter. Threshold: If >5% of queries ask "which tier?", show on every recall.

3. **Empty-State Actionability** — Current: Show suggestions ("Try a broader query"). Evidence gate: Log-based analysis (follow-up query rate, remediation success). Threshold: If remediation_success_rate >70%, keep suggestions; otherwise drop to factual-only.

4. **Contemplate Verbosity** — Current: Silent (v1 doesn't ship contemplate; v1.5 pending). Evidence gate: Post-contemplate confusion + summary action-upon rate. Threshold: If >10% ask "did Eureka run?", default to summary; otherwise silent.

**Evidence Collection Plan:** 10+ dogfood sessions (Aaron), telemetry counters, log-based metrics, post-session interviews (sessions 5 + 10). **Lock gate:** Cannot commit v1.5 friction decisions until dogfood evidence is analyzed.

**Instrumentation required:** Telemetry counters already in v1 scope. Interview protocol TBD.

### 2026-05-27: Narrower Substrate Freeze Proposal — Accepted with Amendments

**Status:** ✅ EVALUATED — Recommendation: ACCEPT  
**Date:** 2026-05-27  
**Initiated By:** Erasmus (Crucible team, via Cassima)  
**Evaluated By:** Genesta (Activities Lead)

**Proposal Summary:** Freeze only two cross-project contracts instead of full Cairn/Forge ownership:
1. `SessionId` brand + validator/constructor in `@akubly/types`
2. `DecisionRecord` shape and source union in Forge

**Genesta's Evaluation:** ✅ **ACCEPT with three amendments:**
- **A1 (Prescriber Opt-In):** Eureka-aware prescriber must be opt-in (explicitly registered), not default-wired into Forge.
- **A2 (SessionId Validation Freeze):** Include validation rules (UUID v4 format, parse/isValid constructors).
- **A3 (DecisionRecord Tolerance Contract):** Freeze adapter tolerance rules (forward/backward-compatible; breaking changes require 15-min sync).

**G4-Lite Governance:** CODEOWNERS for `@akubly/types` (both teams required), CHANGELOG for DecisionRecord changes, Slack handoff for breaking changes. No label automation needed (only 2 contracts vs full packages).

**Confidence:** HIGH. Narrower freeze covers all v1 contracts, reduces coordination overhead by 80-90% vs original scope.

**Next steps:** Graham configures CODEOWNERS (<10 min); SessionId brand lands this week (with validation rules per A2); DecisionRecord v0 frozen with tolerance contract (per A3).

**Signed:** Genesta (Eureka Lead), Cassima (PM)

### 2026-05-27: Crucible ↔ Eureka Cross-Project Overlap — Architectural Coordination Required

**Status:** ⏳ AWAITING AARON DECISION  
**Date:** 2026-05-26  
**Initiated By:** Cross-project overlap analysis (Genesta, Crispin, Edgar, Cassima)  
**Urgency:** BLOCKER — both projects ship v1 in parallel  

**Decision Needed:** Aaron must lock repository ownership, schema collision resolution, and prescriber/substrate wiring before Crucible sprint 2 and Eureka v1 implementation phase begin.

### 2026-05-27: Eureka TD Re-Pass After §55 — §20/§30/§40/§50 Aligned with London-TDD Spine

**Status:** ✅ AUDIT COMPLETE — Recommendations applied  
**Date:** 2026-05-27  
**Initiated By:** Aaron Kubly  
**Question:** Should we do a TD re-pass after §55?  
**Decision:** Full bounded pass (Option A) — parallel audits across §20/§30/§40/§50 + follow-up executions  

**Summary:** Six-agent batch (Crispin/Roger/Laura/Edgar × 2 phases) verified that all four predecessor sections align with §55's London-school TDD mock contract discipline. All seams identified, all gaps addressed. No schema rewrites needed; seams are fundamentally sound with additive clarifications.

**Phase 1 — Audits & Executions:**

1. **Crispin (§20 Audit):** SEAMS HOLD — 5 findings, 1 interface addition (session_id to RecallQuery). No schema changes. **Deliverable:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/crispin-20-seam-audit-vs-55.md`

2. **Roger (§40 DI Audit):** 80% injectable — 2 seams need extraction (`ClockProvider`, `RandomSource`), 1 correctly deferred (model). Forward-docs network boundary for v1.5. **Deliverable:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/roger-40-di-seam-audit-vs-55.md`

3. **Laura (§50 Reframe):** §50 positioned as design-time testability discipline; §55 as implementation-time TDD practice. Complementary pair. **Deliverable:** Edited `docs/eureka/sections/50-testability.md` (+9%)

4. **Edgar (§30 Follow-Ups):** 3/3 executed — CuratorStore signature adopted, ClockProvider seam added, latency cross-refs established. **Deliverable:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/edgar-30-followups-executed.md`, edited `docs/eureka/sections/30-learning-systems.md`

**Phase 2 — Recommendations Applied:**

5. **Crispin (§20 Apply):** §7.4 "Storage Seam (Mock Boundary)" added (names `FactStore` interface explicitly). RecallQuery updated. TDD notes added. **Deliverable:** Edited `docs/eureka/sections/20-knowledge-representation.md` (+12%)

6. **Roger (§40 Apply):** §40.5.4 "Time Injection" + §40.5.5 "RNG Injection (v1.5)" added. Network/model seams forward-documented. **Deliverable:** Edited `docs/eureka/sections/40-integration.md` (+19.8%)

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ All four sections now London-school-aligned with §55 spine
- ✅ I/O seams correctly identified; mock boundaries explicit
- ✅ Time/RNG injection patterns extracted (§30 + §40 coordinated)
- ✅ Phase 2 follow-ups landed without cross-section conflicts
- ✅ Zero implementation blockers; seams are fundamentally sound

**Learnings:**
- Parallel audits work well for cross-section stress-testing
- London-school TDD cascades to design docs (seams, boundaries, time injection)
- "Defer != ignore" — forward-document seams now, extract later (v1.5)
- Bidirectional cross-refs prevent §30–§55 latency-target drift

**Timeline:** Complete. §20/§30/§40/§50 ship-ready with full seam documentation verified.

**Session log:** `.squad/log/2026-05-27T15-30-00Z-td-repass-after-55.md`  
**Orchestration logs:** 6 logs per agent (`.squad/orchestration-log/2026-05-27T*-{agent}.md`)

**Signed:** Scribe (orchestration logger), Crispin, Roger, Laura, Edgar

## Executive Summary

**Convergent Finding:** Crucible (v1-DRAFT) and Eureka (v5-final) both depend on shared substrate (Cairn, Forge, types) and both define overlapping session/decision/improvement semantics. The dependency direction is backwards: Crucible assumes Forge exists in `harness` repo but Forge actually lives in `mem` repo. The overlap is NOT accidental — Eureka is Crucible's future memory layer — but the shared-code surface is brittle without explicit coordination.

**Three critical blockers identified:**

1. **Undeclared Repository Dependency (BLOCKER — Cassima)** — Crucible cannot ship v1 without either duplicating Forge or depending on the `mem` repo. Neither is currently acknowledged in either PRD. Must resolve before sprint 2.

2. **Event Schema Collision (HIGH RISK — Genesta)** — Crucible's 5 primitives + L1 WAL vs Cairn's existing `event_log` creates dual-write trap. Must merge or federate before L1 substrate lands.

3. **Decision/SessionId Schema Dual Ownership (CRITICAL — Crispin, Genesta)** — Both PRDs mandate `SessionId` branded type + Decision schema overlap (Decision primitive ≠ DecisionRecord audit ≠ DecisionPayload learning). Requires namespace discipline + possible renames in Crucible.

**Two safe convergences identified (Edgar, Genesta):**

4. **Prescriber Pattern Convergence** — Crucible's Router mirrors Forge's existing prescriber family; can share substrate. Both teams should annotate convergence points.

5. **Learning-Loop Feedback Substrate** — Crucible's recorded sessions ARE Eureka's training data. Path 2 ingestion wiring enables productive relationship between self-improvement loops (not competitive).

---

## Three Strategic Questions for Aaron (Cassima)

**Q1: Which repo owns Cairn and Forge?**
- If `mem`: Crucible has undeclared dependency on this repo; merge or link must happen before Crucible ships.
- If `harness`: Eureka loses its substrate; Cairn must be forked/mirrored.
- If duplicated: drift is guaranteed.

**Recommendation:** Lock repository topology NOW. Genesta suggests Option A (merge Crucible into `mem` at v2 stage, maintaining federation boundary for isolated dogfood in `harness` repo).

**Q2: Is Eureka a v1 Crucible feature or separate v2+ integration?**
- Crucible promises "local-first sovereignty + record everything + self-improve" (§0).
- Eureka promises "durable, addressable, progressively disclosed knowledge" (§2).
- 80% mission overlap.

**Recommendation:** Clarify v1 scope. If Eureka is Crucible's built-in memory backend at v1, sequencing/dogfood changes. If separate v2+ integration, acknowledge delayed feedback substrate.

**Q3: Who gets Aaron's time when both projects hit the same blocker?**
- Both assume Aaron is sole dogfooder.
- Eureka v1 killer demos (US-1, US-2) require multi-session coding work.
- Crucible v1 success bar requires building v2 inside v1.
- Single-threaded resource bottleneck risk.

**Recommendation:** Sequence dogfood phases OR delegate one project's dogfood to external user.

---

## Technical Findings (Cross-Referenced)

### Finding 1: Repository Dependency (Cassima)
**Full analysis:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/cassima-crucible-eureka-impact.md` §1.2 (undeclared dependency), §4 (resourcing)

- Crucible PRD §1 vocabulary, §2.4, §2.6, Appendix D assume Forge prescribers in `harness`.
- Actual location: `D:\git\mem\packages\forge`.
- Neither PRD acknowledges the cross-repo dependency.

**Recommendation:** Stagger projects OR establish explicit dependency + versioning contract.

### Finding 2: Event Schema Collision (Genesta)
**Full analysis:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/genesta-crucible-eureka-overlap.md` § Finding 1 + 2 + 5

- Crucible §1: 5 typed events (Request, Artifact, Observation, Decision, Question)
- Cairn today: `event_log` with existing `eventType` vocabulary
- Eureka v5: Sessions are `kind=session` facts in Eureka's fact store
- **Dual-write trap:** Which is authoritative for replay?

**Recommendation Option A (Merge):** Crucible's 5 primitives become `eventType` values in Cairn's `event_log`. Crucible's "primitives" are typed façade over Cairn's polymorphic stream.

**Recommendation Option B (Federate):** Crucible ships in `harness` repo (separate). When merged to `stunning-adventure` at v2 stage, federation boundary explicit. Cairn observes Crucible sessions via MCP bridge.

**Gate:** Before Crucible sprint 2 (L1 substrate), convene Graham + Roger + Genesta to lock event-substrate topology.

### Finding 3: SessionId Brand + Decision Schema Collision (Crispin, Genesta)
**Full analysis:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/crispin-crucible-kr-overlap.md` § 1 + 5, `genesta-...` § Finding 2

**Collision 1 — SessionId Brand (BLOCKER):**
- Eureka v5 (FR-13): `SessionId` branded type in `@akubly/types` (Aaron R8 directive).
- Crucible PRD: Implicitly assumes session identity but doesn't specify the type.
- **Both mandate the same brand; Crucible's requirements differ.**

**Recommendation:** Design `SessionId` for both Crucible + Eureka from day 1. Current design (UUID + validator) is sufficient for both.

**Collision 2 — "Decision" Naming (CRITICAL):**
- Crucible `Decision` primitive (§1): "any recorded choice by human or agent" — event-like primitive.
- Forge `DecisionRecord` (audit): Structured audit trail of agent decisions.
- Eureka `DecisionPayload` (fact): Contemplative structured deliberation with explicit options + rationale.
- Same word, three structurally different types.

**Recommendation (Crispin):** Crucible rename `Decision` → `ChoiceEvent` or `DecisionEvent`. ESLint ban on cross-system `Decision*` imports.

**Collision 3 — "Artifact" Semantic Drift (HIGH):**
- Crucible: "any reviewable content — inputs AND outputs" (PRD, patch, screenshot, transcript, upload, diff).
- Eureka: Informal usage only; "epistemological artifact" = learned memory representation.
- Risk at storage layer if both use content-addressed store.

**Recommendation (Crispin):** Crucible rename to `ContentBlob` / `CapturedContent`. Eureka avoid "artifact" in public types.

### Finding 4: Learning-Loop Feedback Substrate (Edgar)
**Full analysis:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/edgar-crucible-learning-overlap.md` § 1–4

- **Crucible's loop:** Prescriber → Review-Gate → Apply/Inbox → Scorecard (minutes to hours per-session).
- **Eureka's loop:** Sweep → Ranker → Trust/Confidence mutations (hours to days across sessions).
- **Complementary, not redundant.** Different time horizons, different improvement targets.

**Judgment: CRUCIBLE IS EUREKA'S EVIDENCE GOLDMINE.**
- Crucible records everything — every decision, every alternative, every tool call, every file read.
- This is exactly the evidence Eureka needs for learning patterns.

**Current wiring (v5-final):** Path 2 ingestion exists but is on-demand only. Manual `eureka ingest-decisions --session <uuid>` after each session won't survive dogfood.

**Recommendation (Edgar):** Wire automatic ingestion before dogfood starts.

**Option 1 (Simplest):** Add Crucible post-session hook: `on_session_end → eureka ingest-decisions --session $SESSION_ID`. Opt-in via `.cruciblerc` flag.

**Option 2 (Event-driven):** Cairn already emits session-end events. Eureka sweep subscribes; on `session_end` (carries `session_id`), ingests Forge DecisionRecord stream. *v1.5 scope per current PRDs.*

**Option 3 (Prescriber ownership transition):** Forge prescribers move to Crucible; Eureka's extraction-ready design enables Crucible to eventually adopt learning kernel.

---

## Recommendations Summary

**Immediate (Pre-Implementation):**
1. Aaron locks repository ownership (mem vs harness vs federation).
2. Graham + Genesta + Roger design event-substrate topology (merge vs federate).
3. Crispin confirms Decision/Artifact renames in Crucible PRD v1.1-DRAFT.
4. Cassima sequences dogfood phases or delegates external user.

**v1 Blockers (Before Sprint 2):**
5. ESLint guardrail (already in Eureka v5-final FR-12 #8) extended to Decision/Artifact cross-system imports.
6. `SessionId` brand finalized in `@akubly/types` (ships v1, both projects).
7. Crucible L1 substrate locked to Cairn's `event_log` (Option A) or isolated to `harness` repo (Option B).

**v1 Opportunity (Nice-to-Have Before Dogfood):**
8. Crucible post-session hook wired for Eureka ingestion (Option 1, simplest).

**v1.5+ (Path D Kernel Extraction):**
9. Prescriber ownership transition (Forge → Crucible).
10. Sweep-trigger unification (Cairn session-end → Eureka sweep).
11. Confidence/trust branded types (orthogonality compiler-enforced).

## Closed Decisions


# Decision: Forge M3 Review Hardening — Vocabulary Constants, E2E Contract, Index

**Date:** 2026-06-05  
**Author:** Graham (Lead/Architect)  
**Branch:** squad/42-forge-m3-disposition  
**Commit:** 07e9a7b  

---

## Context

A 5-persona Code Panel reviewed the M3 hint-disposition feedback loop (commit c39c61d). The panel found zero blocking issues but surfaced 8 hardening improvements (A–H). This document records the design decisions made during the hardening pass.

---

## Decision 1: Shared vocabulary constants (Finding C)

**Problem:** The payload key names for `hint_state_transition` events (`skill_id`, `hint_id`, `resolution_disposition`, `source`, etc.), the event type string (`hint_state_transition`), and the source gating value (`mcp`) were duplicated as string literals between:
- The producer: `emitHintTransitionEvent` in `optimizationHints.ts`
- The consumer SQL: `SqliteHintDispositionProvider` in `sqliteHintDispositionProvider.ts`

Drift between the two silently disables M3 — a renamed key produces no compile error, no test failure (unless the contract test runs), and no runtime error. The mismatch simply returns empty dispositions and M3 appears to work while doing nothing.

**Decision:** Create `packages/cairn/src/db/hintStateTransitionConstants.ts` with:
- `HINT_STATE_TRANSITION_EVENT_TYPE` — event type string
- `HINT_TRANSITION_SOURCE_MCP` — the gating source value
- `HINT_TRANSITION_PAYLOAD_KEYS` — object of payload key names

Both the emitter (using computed property keys in the payload object) and the consumer (using template literals to construct the SQL) reference these constants. A rename in the constants file causes a compile error in both callsites simultaneously.

**Trade-off considered:** Using computed property keys (`{ [K.SKILL_ID]: value }`) slightly loosens TypeScript's type inference compared to literal property names. The payload is `Record<string, unknown>` throughout — no type information is lost.

---

## Decision 2: Producer/consumer contract test (Finding C + H)

**Problem:** `dispositionIntegration.test.ts` hand-rolled a `emitMcpDisposition` helper that manually called `cairn.logEvent` with hardcoded string literals. This means the test exercised the `SqliteHintDispositionProvider` SQL but NOT the actual event format produced by `resolveOptimizationHint`. The MCP→event-format contract was not tested end-to-end.

**Decision:**
1. Switch `dispositionIntegration.test.ts` to call `cairn.resolveOptimizationHint` directly — exercises the full real code path.
2. Add a dedicated contract test in `sqliteHintDispositionProvider.test.ts` that reads the raw event log payload and asserts the key names match `HINT_TRANSITION_PAYLOAD_KEYS` constants.

**Required export additions:** `resolveOptimizationHint`, `HintResolution`, and `ResolveHintResult` added to cairn's public index.ts exports (they were previously package-internal).

---

## Decision 3: INNER JOIN limitation for E (Finding E)

**Problem:** The provider's SQL joins `event_log` with `optimization_hints` to obtain the hint's `category`. If `deleteOptimizationHint` is called on a previously dismissed hint, the JOIN match disappears and the dismissal becomes invisible to the provider.

**Options evaluated:**
- **(a)** Carry `category` in the `hint_state_transition` event payload at emit time; aggregate from the event alone without JOIN. Removes the dependency entirely.
- **(b)** Document as known limitation.

**Decision: (b) — document.**

Rationale:
- `deleteOptimizationHint` is a low-level CRUD function not exposed in the public MCP API. The real MCP resolve path transitions hints to `rejected` status (row retained) — delete is not a normal resolution action.
- Option (a) requires backward migration of existing `event_log` rows in production DBs. Old events don't have `category` in their payloads, so any SQL change to aggregate from the event alone would silently drop those events unless a fallback JOIN is kept — which negates most of the benefit.
- The correct remediation if a hard-delete path is ever added to the public API is to add `category` to the event payload at that time. The comment in `SqliteHintDispositionProvider` describes this remediation path.

---

## Decision 4: Schema version bump to 18 (Finding B)

**Migration 018** creates `idx_event_log_type` on `event_log(event_type)`. Every cairn migration test that checks for the latest schema version must be updated when a new migration is added. The affected tests are:
- `db.test.ts` — two assertions (MAX version, idempotency count)
- `migration012.test.ts` — two assertions
- `discovery.test.ts` — one assertion
- `prescriptions.test.ts` — one assertion

Migration 018 includes a table-existence guard (pattern from migration017) so partial-schema test databases that seed a schema_version below 001/004 (before `event_log` was created) do not fail.

---

## Cycle-2 Addendum (2026-06-05, commit ca03d71)

### Decision 5: Resolution-value constant ownership (Finding C complete)

**Problem (residual):** After cycle 1, `HINT_TRANSITION_PAYLOAD_KEYS` centralized key names but the resolution *values* (`'dismissed'`/`'resolved'`) were still hardcoded literals in the provider SQL CASE/WHEN.

**Decision:** Add `HINT_RESOLUTION_RESOLVED = 'resolved' as const` and `HINT_RESOLUTION_DISMISSED = 'dismissed' as const` to `hintStateTransitionConstants.ts`. `optimizationHints.ts` derives `HintResolution` type and `HINT_RESOLUTIONS` tuple from these constants. `sqliteHintDispositionProvider.ts` uses them in SQL template literals.

**Circular-dep analysis:** Constants file has zero upstream imports — no cycle. `optimizationHints.ts` already imports from it; adding two more imports is clean.

### Decision 6: Migration 018 skip-path documentation (Finding 2)

**Decision: comment-only.** No startup assertion. `event_log` is unconditionally created in migration 001. Any DB that can reach migration 018 has the table — the skip is structurally unreachable in production. Expanded comment documents the 001/004 guarantee and tightens the warning message.

### Decision 7: Public export policy for resolveOptimizationHint (Finding 3)

**Decision: keep as public API.** `resolveOptimizationHint` is the primary user-driven closure operation. Its type contract (`HintResolution`, `HINT_RESOLUTIONS`, `ResolveHintResult`) is legitimately public. Integration tests correctly import from the public root. Added justification comment in `cairn/src/index.ts`.



# Test Strategy Decision: Forge M3 Disposition Hardening

**Date:** 2026-06-05  
**Author:** Laura (Tester)  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Related:** Graham's M3 decision (`graham-forge-m3-disposition-consumer.md`), Issue #42

---

## Context

Graham's M3 implementation shipped 16 tests (+9 cairn, +7 forge). Aaron flagged 5 adversarial gaps requiring explicit fixture coverage before M3 can be signed off:

1. Suppression permanence: `dismissedCount=2` must still suppress
2. Confidence ceiling: high-confidence hint + boost → clamped to `≤1.0`
3. Concurrent/mixed transitions: both dismissed AND resolved for same category → documented precedence
4. End-to-end integration wire: real Cairn event → runtime → forge chain
5. Boundary: `source!=mcp` and null/absent disposition → no-op

---

## Test Strategy Decisions

### Decision 1: Pure unit tests for `applyDispositions`

Added `packages/forge/src/prescribers/utils.test.ts` (new file, 10 tests) targeting the pure function directly. **Why a new file rather than using the orchestrator tests?**

- The orchestrator tests go through `runForgePrescribers` which generates hints from a profile. Precise confidence values depend on prescriber thresholds — harder to set up ceiling cases.
- `applyDispositions` is a pure function. Unit testing it directly gives cleaner fixtures and faster signal.
- The orchestrator tests stay focused on orchestration semantics (provider injection, fail-open, etc.).

### Decision 2: Separate describe block for adversarial orchestrator tests

Added 4 tests to a new `describe("runForgePrescribers — M3 adversarial edge cases")` block in `forgePrescriberOrchestrator.test.ts`. **Why not modify existing tests?**

- Graham's existing 7 tests cover the happy path. The adversarial tests are by nature separate concerns — they stress-test boundary conditions, not primary behaviors.
- Separate block clearly signals "these are the hardening tests Aaron requested" for future readers.

### Decision 3: Integration test tier via `executePrescriberRun` (not MCP handler)

Used `executePrescriberRun` directly (not `forgePrescribeHandler`) in `dispositionIntegration.test.ts`. **Why?**

- `executePrescriberRun` is the layer that wires `SqliteHintDispositionProvider` — it's the right seam for testing the full chain.
- `forgePrescribeHandler` adds MCP protocol overhead not relevant to the disposition chain.
- Existing `forgePrescribeMcp.test.ts` already covers the MCP handler layer.

### Decision 4: Seed disposition events via `logEvent` directly

Rather than relying on the non-exported `resolveOptimizationHint` function, the integration tests use `cairn.insertHintIfNew` + `cairn.logEvent` to emit `hint_state_transition` events with `source='mcp'`. **Why?**

- `resolveOptimizationHint` is not exported from `@akubly/cairn` (not public API).
- Using `logEvent` directly is more explicit about the event format — useful for adversarial cases like source=system or absent source.
- The test is more transparent: it shows exactly what fields `SqliteHintDispositionProvider` relies on.

### Decision 5: Cairn provider boundary tests — INNER JOIN orphan

Added test: emit a source='mcp' event that references a non-existent `hint_id`. The SQL uses INNER JOIN on `optimization_hints` — the orphan event should not produce a row. This is a defense-in-depth test documenting an implicit contract: **disposition events without a matching `optimization_hints` row are silently excluded**. This is correct behavior but must be documented and locked.

---

## Test Counts After Hardening

| Package | Graham +9/+7 | Laura +14/+3/+4 |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| cairn | 725 | 728 |
| forge | 651 | 665 |
| skillsmith-runtime | 49 | 53 |

---

## Patterns for Future Disposition Tests

1. **Seed order matters:** Always seed the hint row and disposition events BEFORE calling `executePrescriberRun`. The DB state is read at call time.

2. **`result.hints` vs inserted hints:** `result.hints` is the pre-insertion list (post-`applyDispositions`). Assertions on `result.hints` reflect the disposition effect. Insertion deduplication doesn't affect it.

3. **INNER JOIN awareness:** If seeding disposition events for a category, the seed hint MUST exist in `optimization_hints`. Orphan events are filtered silently.

4. **Confidence ceiling fixture:** Use `sessionCount=9` → `Math.min(1, 9/10) = 0.9` → `0.9 * 1.2 = 1.08` → clamped to `1.0`. This is the sharpest ceiling fixture using the prescribers' own formula.

### Decision

**The next load-bearing move for forge is building the Eureka SQLite FactStore adapter.** Without it, `recall` is unreachable in production and the forge→Eureka integration loop cannot be validated.

**Sequence (when Eureka stabilizes):**
1. **Eureka SQLite FactStore adapter** — `packages/eureka/src/adapters/sqlite-fact-store.ts`, implements `FactStore.search()` against Eureka's SQLite DB. M, Edgar or Roger. This is Eureka's M5 milestone deliverable.
2. **Wire `recall` into `ForgePrescriberOrchestrator`** — add optional `factStore?: FactStore` alongside existing `provider?: ChangeVectorProvider`. Fail-open (recall failure → prescribe without episodic context). S-M, Alexander. Forge imports `FactStore` type from `@akubly/eureka` only (no impl coupling).
3. **`trustFloor` RecallOptions override** — small plumbing in `packages/eureka/src/activities/recall.ts`; seam already supports `minTrust` at FactStore boundary, just needs wiring. S, any agent.

### What to defer

- Eureka `commit` activity (v1.5+) — don't design before FactStore + recall wiring is proven.
- Issue #17 async-IO sweep implementation — Alexander's T3 closed the W5-5 gaps; issue should be closed, not implemented. `better-sqlite3` sync model is acceptable for single-user local tool.

### Risk

Schema lock-in for FactStore SQLite backing: trust/importance/attentionTier storage must be durable. Any migration later breaks cognitive memory. Design the schema defensively (nullable fields, enum TEXT columns with normalizeX guards matching the `normalizeProfileSource` pattern from PR #32).

### Current Status

Deferred per Aaron's dogfood-first priority (2026-05-30). Will be picked up after M0/M1/M2 complete and Eureka v1 stabilizes.

## 2026-05-31: Cycle-2 Latent Lint Bug Pattern — Windows `npm run lint` Glob Failure

**Date:** 2026-05-31  
**Author:** Alexander (via Scribe, Issue #37)  
**Status:** ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED; WORKAROUND DOCUMENTED; PERMANENT FIX TRACKED

### What

`npm run lint` fails on Windows with silent no-match (eslint glob `packages/*/src/` matches nothing via PowerShell glob expansion). Agents pushing code from Windows worktrees don't catch lint errors; Linux CI flags them post-merge. Example: commit 85d49b8 (PR #36 turn alexander-8) discovered unused-variable error during CI run, not local development.

### Root Cause

ESLint glob expansion via Node.js child_process on Windows uses native PowerShell glob rules (not sh glob rules). The pattern `packages/*/src/` expands to zero matches because PowerShell treats `*` literally when no files match at the top level. On Linux (`sh`), the glob expands correctly.

### Workaround

**UNTIL ISSUE #37 IS FIXED:** Agents modifying any package must use:
```bash
npm run lint --workspace=<package-name>
```

Examples:
```bash
npm run lint --workspace=forge
npm run lint --workspace=eureka
npm run lint --workspace=cairn
```

This bypasses the glob entirely and runs eslint directly on the package's source tree.

### Permanent Fix

**Tracked in Issue #37 (squad:gabriel):** Rewrite ESLint glob pattern or use a different linting approach:
- Option A: Use `packages/{cairn,forge,eureka,types}/**/*.ts` (explicit list)
- Option B: Run linter per-package in parallel (robust to glob expansion issues)
- Option C: Use ESLint's built-in workspace support (v8+)

### Team Discipline

Until fixed, Scribe will flag any `npm run lint` (bare, not `--workspace=...`) runs in orchestration logs as **ANTI-PATTERN** and agents are expected to use the per-package form.

### Follow-Up

Add CI check to detect `npm run lint` (bare) in agent logs and fail CI with helpful error message pointing to Issue #37 + workaround.

### 2026-06-01: Crucible Sprint 0 — First GREEN Cycle (Roger)

# Roger: Crucible First GREEN — Decision Inbox

**Date:** 2026-06-01  
**Author:** Roger (Platform Dev)  
**Status:** GREEN confirmed — acceptance test passing

---

## 1. Packages Scaffolded

### `packages/crucible-core/`
New package `@akubly/crucible-core` v0.1.0.

Files created:
- `package.json` — name `@akubly/crucible-core`, type module, `main/types` → `dist/`, scripts: build/test/typecheck/clean, deps: `@akubly/types: *`, devDeps: `@types/node ^25.5.0`, `vitest ^3`
- `tsconfig.json` — mirrors crucible-cli: ES2022, Node16 module, composite, strict, references `../types`
- `README.md` — one paragraph description
- `vitest.config.ts` — standard node environment, `include: ['src/**/*.test.ts']`
- `src/types.ts` — types-only module (no runtime code)
- `src/session.ts` — createSession + fork implementation
- `src/index.ts` — barrel re-export

### `packages/crucible-cli/` (modified)
- `src/index.ts` — now re-exports `{ createSession, fork }` from `@akubly/crucible-core`
- `package.json` — added `"@akubly/crucible-core": "*"` to dependencies
- `tsconfig.json` — added `{ "path": "../crucible-core" }` to references

### Root `tsconfig.json`
Added references: `packages/crucible-core` and `packages/crucible-cli`.

## 2. Public Types and Functions — Shapes

```ts
// §6 five-kind vocabulary
type PrimitiveKind = 'request' | 'artifact' | 'observation' | 'decision' | 'question';

interface PrimitiveInput {
  primitiveKind: PrimitiveKind;
  primitivePayload: unknown;
  causalReadSet: string[];
}

// Committed primitive — PrimitiveInput + logical offset
interface Primitive extends PrimitiveInput {
  offset: number;
}

interface SessionMetadata {
  parentSessionId: string | null;
  forkPointEventId: number | null;
  createdAt: number;
}

interface Session {
  id: string;
  metadata: SessionMetadata;
  append(p: PrimitiveInput): Promise<void>;
  query(opts: { range: [number, number] }): Promise<Primitive[]>;
}

function createSession(): Promise<Session>;
function fork(parentId: string, opts: { atOffset: number }): Promise<Session>;
```

---

## 3. Range Convention: Inclusive-Inclusive

**Decision:** `query({ range: [a, b] })` is **inclusive on both ends**:  
- `[0, 46]` returns 47 primitives (offsets 0, 1, …, 46)  
- `[0, 23]` returns 24 primitives  

**Evidence from test:** `query({ range: [0, 46] })` → `toHaveLength(47)` → 47 = 46 − 0 + 1 ✓

---

## 4. In-Memory Parent-Registry Approach

A module-level `Map<string, Primitive[]>` holds each session's **own events**:

- **Root sessions:** own events are the complete event log; offset = array index.
- **Child (forked) sessions:** own events contain only primitives appended *after* the fork. Events at offset ≤ `forkPointEventId` are served by **delegating to the parent registry entry** — no physical copy.

**Rationale:** This satisfies A1 invariant 3 (child prefix equals parent prefix [0..23]) and invariant 4 (parent unmodified) without copying. The parent's `registry` entry remains untouched; the child's `query` reads from it transparently.

**Offset assignment for child append:**
```ts
const baseOffset = forkPointEventId === null ? 0 : forkPointEventId + 1;
const offset = baseOffset + ownEvents.length;
```

## 6. Deferred: Ledger Abstraction

No `Ledger` class, no `WAL` interface, no Cairn integration in this turn. This is the **GREEN phase only** — simplest correct implementation behind the acceptance API. The REFACTOR step (next TDD cycle) is where a Ledger collaborator abstraction would be introduced, followed by the London-school descent to introduce an L1 mock layer. Deferred per Graham's sprint plan (OQ-2).

# Decision Drop: Crucible REFACTOR Cycle — SessionManager Unit Tests (RED)

**Author:** Laura (Tester)  
**Date:** 2026-06-01  
**Beat:** REFACTOR cycle RED — SessionManager unit tests with mocked DB collaborator  
**Status:** RED — 4 tests failing (`TypeError: SessionManager is not a constructor`)

---

## What Landed

**File:** `packages/crucible-core/src/__tests__/unit/session-manager.test.ts`

4 unit tests authored per §4.1 Refactor 2, London-school style with a mocked `DB` collaborator:

| # | Test name | Invariant locked |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Unit: SessionManager.forkSession() rejects fork beyond parent ledger size` | Fork offset > parent ledger size throws with message matching `/exceeds parent ledger size 47/` |
| 2 | `Unit: SessionManager.forkSession() rejects negative fork offset` | Fork offset < 0 throws with message matching `/non-negative\|negative/` |
| 3 | `Unit: SessionManager.forkSession() child session inherits transitive dependency graph from parent` | `DB.insertSession` called with full `pluginVersions` map (transitive graph intact) |
| 4 | `Unit: SessionManager.forkSession() child fork lineage records parentSessionId and forkPointEventId` | `DB.insertSession` called with `{ parentSessionId: 'parent-id', forkPointEventId: 23 }` |

---

## MockDB Shape Locked

```typescript
type MockDB = {
  getSession:    ReturnType<typeof vi.fn>;  // → { id, ledgerSize, pluginVersions? }
  insertSession: ReturnType<typeof vi.fn>;  // ← { id, parentSessionId, forkPointEventId, pluginVersions, createdAt }
  queryEvents:   ReturnType<typeof vi.fn>;  // reserved — not yet called in these scenarios
};
```

`mockDB.getSession.mockResolvedValue({ id: 'parent-id', ledgerSize: 47, pluginVersions?: {...} })`  
`mockDB.insertSession.mockResolvedValue('child-id')` — for success-path tests.

**`queryEvents` is present on the shape** so negative-path tests can assert it was NOT called (validation fails before any event query).

---

## RED Confirmation

```
TypeError: SessionManager is not a constructor
  ❯ src/__tests__/unit/session-manager.test.ts:77:23
  ❯ src/__tests__/unit/session-manager.test.ts:96:23

  ❯ src/__tests__/unit/session-manager.test.ts:144:23

Test Files  1 failed (1)
     Tests  4 failed (4)
```

`SessionManager` imported from `../../index.js` — not yet exported from Roger's in-memory sprint 0 implementation. Correct RED signal.

---

## Proactive Edge Case (Test #2)

Test #2 (`rejects negative fork offset`) is not in §4.1 verbatim — it is a proactive extension of the `ForkLineage` invariant ("Fork point must be non-negative"). The regex `/non-negative|negative/` gives Roger phrasing freedom. This is Laura's charter: edge cases aren't optional.

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate — Roger (REFACTOR)

Roger's REFACTOR cycle must:

1. **Extract `SessionManager` class** from the module-level functions in `session.ts`.
   - Constructor signature: `new SessionManager(db: DB)` where `DB` matches the mockDB shape above.
   - `forkSession(parentId: string, forkOffset: number): Promise<string>` — returns child session ID string.

2. **Implement validation** in `forkSession`:
   - Call `db.getSession(parentId)` → get `{ ledgerSize }`.
   - If `forkOffset < 0` → throw with message matching `/non-negative|negative/`.
   - If `forkOffset > ledgerSize` → throw with message matching `/exceeds parent ledger size <N>/`.

3. **Implement happy path** in `forkSession`:
   - Generate a new child UUID.
   - Call `db.insertSession({ id, parentSessionId, forkPointEventId, pluginVersions, createdAt })`.
   - Return child `id`.

4. **Export `SessionManager`** from `packages/crucible-core/src/index.ts`.

5. **Keep acceptance test GREEN**: `packages/crucible-cli/src/__tests__/acceptance/session-fork.test.ts` (1 test) must remain passing. Roger's in-memory `fork` function can coexist or be internalized into `SessionManager`.

### Follow-up — Laura (§4.1 Refactor 3 + §7 Mock Drift)

- **Integration test**: `packages/crucible-cli/src/__tests__/integration/session-fork.integration.ts` — real SQLite DB (`:memory:`), verify schema correctness and ledger prefix semantics.
- **Mock Drift Defense (§7)**: Extract `makeMockDB()` from inline to `packages/crucible-core/src/__tests__/fixtures/mock-db-builder.ts` once Roger's `DB` interface is formally typed.

---

## Acceptance Test Guard

The existing acceptance test **must remain GREEN** after Roger's REFACTOR:

```
packages/crucible-cli/src/__tests__/acceptance/session-fork.test.ts (1 test) ✅
```

Roger's refactor must not change the public `fork` / `createSession` API surface.

# Decision: Crucible Sprint 0 — REFACTOR Phase: SessionManager + ForkLineage

**Author:** Roger (Platform Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-06-01  
**Sprint:** 0 — REFACTOR cycle (§4.1 Refactor 1 + 2)  
**Status:** COMPLETE — both test layers GREEN

---

## What was done

### Refactor 1: ForkLineage value object extracted

**File:** `packages/crucible-core/src/ledger/fork-lineage.ts`

Extracted a `ForkLineage` value object that encapsulates fork ancestry invariants:

- Constructor `(parentSessionId: string | null, forkPointEventId: number)` — typed `string | null` (not just `string`) so `ForkLineage.root()` can produce a valid sentinel without a non-null assertion.
- Throws `"Fork point must be non-negative"` when `forkPointEventId < 0`.
- `static root()` — returns `new ForkLineage(null, 0)`, sentinel for root sessions.
- `isRoot(): boolean` — returns `parentSessionId === null`.

The `string | null` deviation from the strategy snippet's `string` type is intentional and documented with a comment in the file: the strategy snippet declares `parentSessionId: string` but `root()` passes `null`, so we accept both.

---

### Refactor 2: SessionManager class + DB interface introduced

**Files:**
- `packages/crucible-core/src/db.ts` — `DB` interface
- `packages/crucible-core/src/session-manager.ts` — `SessionManager` class

#### DB interface (locked shape — must match Laura's mockDB)

```ts
export interface DB {
  getSession(
    id: string,
  ): Promise<{ id: string; ledgerSize: number; pluginVersions?: Record<string, string> } | null>;

  insertSession(session: {
    id: string;
    parentSessionId: string | null;
    forkPointEventId: number | null;
    pluginVersions?: Record<string, string>;
    createdAt: number;
  }): Promise<void>;

  queryEvents(id: string, opts: { range: [number, number] }): Promise<unknown[]>;
}
```

#### SessionManager.forkSession() validation order

1. `db.getSession(parentId)` → throw `"Parent session {id} not found"` if null.
2. `forkOffset > parent.ledgerSize` → throw `"Fork point {n} exceeds parent ledger size {m}"`.
3. `new ForkLineage(parentId, forkOffset)` → throws `"Fork point must be non-negative"` if negative.
4. `db.insertSession(...)` — forwards `parent.pluginVersions` verbatim (transitive dep graph).
5. Returns `crypto.randomUUID()` child id.

---

### Refactor 2b: In-memory DB adapter (`createInMemoryDB`)

**File:** `packages/crucible-core/src/in-memory-db.ts`

Created `createInMemoryDB(): InMemoryDB` factory that backs the Sprint 0 in-memory state. `InMemoryDB` extends `DB` with internal helpers (`insertRootSession`, `pushEvent`, `getOwnEvents`, `getMetadata`) used only by `session.ts` composition layer — not visible to `SessionManager`.

`ledgerSize` computation:
- Root sessions: `ownEvents.length`
- Child sessions: `forkPointEventId + 1 + ownEvents.length`

---

### Backward compatibility: session.ts wired to singleton adapter

`session.ts` was refactored to:
- Create a module-level `db = createInMemoryDB()` + `manager = new SessionManager(db)`.
- `createSession()` calls `db.insertRootSession()` directly (no DB interface; root sessions don't go through SessionManager).
- `fork()` calls `manager.forkSession()` for all invariant checks + DB insert, then builds the `Session` object using `db.getMetadata()` + `db.getOwnEvents()`.
- `buildSession()` uses `db.pushEvent()` / `db.getOwnEvents()` instead of the old module-level `registry` Map.

The old `registry` Map is gone; the in-memory DB owns all state.

---

### Barrel update

`packages/crucible-core/src/index.ts` now exports:
- `createSession`, `fork` (unchanged public surface)
- `SessionManager` (class)
- `DB` (interface — type-only)
- `ForkLineage` (class)
- `createInMemoryDB` (factory)
- `InMemoryDB` (interface — type-only)
- Existing types (`PrimitiveKind`, `PrimitiveInput`, `Primitive`, `SessionMetadata`, `Session`)

---

## Test results

### Unit tests (Laura's file — verified GREEN)

```
✓ src/__tests__/unit/session-manager.test.ts (4 tests)
  ✓ Unit: SessionManager.forkSession() rejects fork beyond parent ledger size
  ✓ Unit: SessionManager.forkSession() rejects negative fork offset
  ✓ Unit: SessionManager.forkSession() child session inherits transitive dependency graph from parent
  ✓ Unit: SessionManager.forkSession() child fork lineage records parentSessionId and forkPointEventId
Test Files 1 passed (1)
Tests 4 passed (4)
```

### Acceptance tests (no regression)

```
✓ src/__tests__/acceptance/session-fork.test.ts (1 test)
  ✓ Acceptance: Fork session creates child with inherited ledger prefix [parentId, forkOffset, childLineage]
Test Files 1 passed (1)
Tests 1 passed (1)
```

### Full monorepo build

`npm run build` — exit 0, no TypeScript errors.

---

## Decisions and tradeoffs

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `ForkLineage.parentSessionId` type | `string \| null` | `root()` requires null; typed string in strategy snippet but null is the correct sentinel value |
| Validation order in forkSession | getSession → ledgerSize check → ForkLineage (negative) | Matches spec; negative check last because ForkLineage is constructed after parent lookup |
| InMemoryDB internal helpers | `InMemoryDB extends DB` interface | Clean separation: DB interface is the mock contract; internal helpers only exist in the concrete adapter |
| `createSession` bypasses SessionManager | Yes — calls `db.insertRootSession` directly | SessionManager.forkSession is the only operation requiring invariant validation; root sessions need no parent lookup |

---

## Deferred

- **Refactor 3: Real SQLite integration stub** — `packages/crucible-cli/src/__tests__/integration/session-fork.integration.ts` + `createTestDatabase()`. Not this turn.
- **Shared-fixture mockDB builder** — `packages/crucible-core/src/__tests__/fixtures/mock-db-builder.ts` (§7 Mock Drift Defense). Not this turn; mockDB is inline in Laura's test file per her note.
- **`SessionManager.createSession()`** — not introduced; root session creation stays in `session.ts` for now. Move to SessionManager when the integration stub lands.

# Decision: Crucible Sprint 0 Topic Branch Recovery

**Date:** 2026-06-01T23:58:20Z  
**Author:** Gabriel (Infrastructure)  
**Upstream Context:** Scribe committed 3 meta-files directly to main while Crucible code work remained uncommitted in the working tree.

## What Happened

Scribe's session consolidation produced:
- **3 meta-commits on main:** b19b683, 193a441, 7cfe8ad (archived decisions, merged inbox, consolidated session logs)
- **Uncommitted code:** packages/crucible-cli, packages/crucible-core, london-tdd-* skills, updated workspace refs

This left main 3 commits ahead of origin/main with unreviewed code still in the working tree.

## Resolution

**Created topic branch:** `squad/crucible-sprint-0-walkthrough-a`

**Committed work on topic branch:**
- **Commit 92a8c2e** — `feat(crucible): Sprint 0 Walkthrough A — RED test + GREEN impl + REFACTOR (SessionManager/ForkLineage)`
  - Staged: packages/crucible-cli, packages/crucible-core, tsconfig.json (workspace refs), package-lock.json
  - Result: 19 files added, 758 insertions
  
- **Commit 01afeb6** — `docs(squad): London-school TDD skills from Crucible Sprint 0`
  - Staged: .squad/skills/london-tdd-first-green, london-tdd-first-red-test, london-tdd-layer-descent, london-tdd-refactor-extract-collaborator
  - Result: 5 files added, 605 insertions

**Reset main:** `git reset --hard origin/main` (HEAD now at c8d7bc7, no commits ahead)

**Final state:**
- Branch `squad/crucible-sprint-0-walkthrough-a`: 5 commits ahead of origin/main (3 Scribe meta + 2 new code)
- Branch `main`: Clean, back at origin/main (c8d7bc7)
- Working tree: Empty (all WIP committed)

## Artifacts Updated

- `.gitignore`: Added patterns `.squad/health-report-*/` and `.squad/scribe-health-report-*/` to exclude Scribe scratch files
- `.squad/agents/gabriel/history.md`: Documented the topic-branch recovery pattern under Learnings

## Test Results

- `npm test --workspace=@akubly/crucible-cli`: ✓ 1 passed
- `npm test --workspace=@akubly/crucible-core`: ✓ 4 passed

## Next Steps

Topic branch is ready for review-cycle skill execution.

# Graham — Cycle 1 Persona Review Fixes

**Date:** 2026-06-02T23:43:43-07:00
**Branch:** squad/crucible-sprint-0-walkthrough-a
**Triggered by:** Cycle 1 persona review findings (I4, I2, M1)

---

## I4: ForkLineage.root() — Chosen Option (a): Remove (YAGNI)

**Alternatives considered:**
- **(a) Remove root() entirely** — zero callers, eliminates inconsistency.
- **(b) Widen constructor to (string | null, number | null)** — makes root() type-correct but ripples into guard clause and isRoot() logic.

**Decision:** Option (a).

**Rationale:** `root()` has zero callers and produces a sentinel (`forkPointEventId = 0`) that conflicts with the `session.ts` convention (`forkPointEventId === null` marks roots). Option (b) would require changing the constructor guard (`forkPointEventId < 0` doesn't handle `null`), updating `isRoot()` to also check `forkPointEventId === null`, and reasoning about whether `ForkLineage(null, null)` is a meaningful state distinct from `ForkLineage(null, 0)`. All that complexity for zero callers. YAGNI — re-introduce when a caller exists and the null semantics are settled.

**Files changed:** `packages/crucible-core/src/ledger/fork-lineage.ts`

---

## I2: InMemoryDB Coupling Documentation

**Placement:** File-header JSDoc in `session.ts`, lines 15–19 (after Sprint 0 deferral note, before `const db = createInMemoryDB()`). Chosen to avoid merge conflicts with Roger's concurrent imports/runtime changes.

**Wording:** 5-line NOTE block naming the four extended methods (getOwnEvents, getMetadata, insertRootSession, pushEvent) and framing the Refactor 3 decision point.

**Files changed:** `packages/crucible-core/src/session.ts` (comment only, no runtime change)

---

## M1: SKILL Doc Drift — Chosen Option (b): Annotate as Sprint 0 Variant

**Alternatives considered:**
- **(a) Update strategy doc** to match Sprint 0's simpler approach — risky, strategy doc is canonical for all sprints.
- **(b) Annotate SKILL as Sprint 0 variant** — lighter, preserves strategy doc as the canonical reference.

**Decision:** Option (b).

**Rationale:** `docs/crucible-tdd-strategy.md` §4.1 shows the full London-school outside-in GREEN with mocked Ledger at each layer. That's the correct general approach. Sprint 0's simpler GREEN (real in-memory, no mocks) was a conscious scope reduction because the acceptance surface fits in a single module. Annotating the SKILL preserves the strategy doc's authority while making the divergence explicit and explaining when the full approach applies.

**Files changed:** `.squad/skills/london-tdd-first-green/SKILL.md`

---

## Build & Test Status

- **Build:** ✅ `npm run build` passes (tsc --build clean)
- **crucible-core tests:** 3 passed, 3 failed (pre-existing — error message wording mismatch in session-manager.test.ts, Laura's domain)
- **crucible-cli tests:** 1 failed (pre-existing — same root cause, not introduced by these changes)

# Cycle 2 Advisory Close-Out — Graham

**Date:** 2026-06-05T10:54:00Z
**Context:** Persona-review Cycle 2 surfaced 3 advisory (NEW) findings on Crucible Sprint 0 Walkthrough A.

## Triage Outcomes

| ID | Category | Disposition | Reasoning |
|----|----------|-------------|-----------|
| N3 | Skeptic, minor | **ACCEPT** | Doc/behavior drift — fork() JSDoc said `≤` but enforcement is strict `<`. Active lie; fixed in-place. |
| N1 | Craft, minor | **ACCEPT** | Barrel export lacked test-only marker. One-line comment added; trivial, good hygiene. |
| N2 | Craft, minor | **DEFER** | `clear()` on InMemoryDB interface obligates future impls to test-only method. Interface is internal-only with one impl. Revisit at Refactor 3 (SQLite adapter). |

## Files Changed

- `packages/crucible-core/src/session.ts` — N3: `≤` → `<` in fork() JSDoc (line 100)
- `packages/crucible-core/src/index.ts` — N1: Split `resetInMemoryDb` export with test-only comment

## Commit

`fix(crucible): Cycle 2 advisory polish — N3 docstring + N1 barrel marker`

# Laura — Cycle 1 Test Updates

**Date:** 2026-06-02

# M8 Slice A — FactReader Contract Audit

**Author:** Laura (Tester)
**Date:** 2026-06-01
**Branch:** `eureka/m8-slice-a-sqlite-factreader`
**Status:** COMPLETE — audit filed, CL-4 tightened, edge test file committed

---

## Purpose

Audit CL-1 through CL-5 in `fact-reader.contract.test.ts` for SQLite-semantic
completeness before Roger's `SqliteFactReader` impl is declared done. SQLite
introduces real serialization/deserialization (NaN→NULL, WAL on-disk state,
shared DB file for all sessions) that the in-memory impl trivially sidesteps.
Each invariant below states whether it survives SQLite semantics unchanged, and
if not, what was tightened.

---

## CL-1 — Happy Path: seeded fact is readable

**Verdict: SURVIVES UNCHANGED.**

The test seeds `trust=0.5` and asserts `{trust: 0.5}`. SQLite's `REAL` column
stores IEEE 754 doubles; `0.5` is exactly representable and round-trips without
rounding error. The SQL query `WHERE fact_id = ? AND session_id = ?` maps
directly to the M8 schema's columns. No SQLite-specific failure mode here. The
test will exercise the full INSERT→SELECT cycle once Roger's harness `seed`
writes via raw SQL (or an internal method) and `reader.read()` queries the DB.

---

## CL-2 — Missing fact returns null (not undefined)

**Verdict: SURVIVES UNCHANGED.**

The test reads a factId that was never seeded and asserts `expect(result).toBeNull()`.
For SQLite, a `SELECT` that matches zero rows returns no rows; the impl maps that
to `null`. Vitest's `toBeNull()` is strict — it rejects `undefined`. The test
will catch both "returns undefined" and "throws on miss" bugs. No special
handling needed.

---

## CL-3 — Session isolation: wrong-session reads return null

**Verdict: SURVIVES UNCHANGED — and is a STRONGER validator for SQLite than for InMemory.**

The in-memory impl uses a `Map<factId, FactRecord[]>` scoped per-process; an
off-by-one on session filtering is contained in the JS heap. For SQLite, both
sessionA and sessionB share a **single DB file**. The `UNIQUE(fact_id,
session_id)` constraint means `(factA, sessionA)` and `(factA, sessionB)` are
distinct rows — but a SQL query that omits `AND session_id = ?` from the WHERE
clause would silently return sessionA's row when sessionB asks for the same
factId. CL-3 catches exactly that bug: seed under sessionA, read under sessionB
→ must be null. This invariant is load-bearing for SQLite correctness and
already covers the cross-session DB-sharing scenario without modification.

---

## CL-4 — NaN passthrough (trust corruption round-trip)

**Verdict: TIGHTENED. Comment strengthened; test title updated.**

**Finding:** CL-4 was silent on whether the harness `seed` function must write
to the backing store before `read` is called. The test name was `"returns
{trust: NaN} for a NaN-seeded fact — read layer does NOT validate"` — framed as
a validation policy test, not a persistence test. For the in-memory impl, seed
and read are both JS-heap operations and there is no serialization gap. For
SQLite, this is the critical failure mode: SQLite has no NaN literal and stores
`NULL` for NaN; `read` must re-hydrate `NULL → NaN`. A naive SQLite harness that
caches the seed value in memory (bypassing the INSERT) would pass the old CL-4
while allowing a real NULL-handling bug to ship silently.

**Before:**

```
// CL-4 — Trust passthrough: corrupt value (NaN)
//
// Seed a fact with trust=NaN → read must return {trust: NaN}.
// The read layer is NOT responsible for validating trust; that is the
// caller's job (applyFeedbackById throws InvalidTrustValueError(source:'storage')).
// Silently clamping or filtering at read time would hide storage corruption.

it('CL-4: returns {trust: NaN} for a NaN-seeded fact — read layer does NOT validate', ...)
```

**After:**

```
// CL-4 — Trust passthrough: corrupt value (NaN)
//
// Seed a fact with trust=NaN → read must return {trust: NaN}.
// The read layer is NOT responsible for validating trust; that is the
// caller's job (applyFeedbackById throws InvalidTrustValueError(source:'storage')).
// Silently clamping or filtering at read time would hide storage corruption.
//
// Storage round-trip requirement: the harness `seed` function MUST write
// NaN to the backing store before `read` is called — not cache it in memory.
// For SQLite implementations, NaN has no native literal and is stored as NULL;
// `read` must re-hydrate NULL → NaN. This test is the primary regression lock
// for that NaN→NULL→NaN conversion path. A seed implementation that bypasses
// the backing store (e.g., caches in-memory) would let a silent conversion
// bug slip through.

it('CL-4: NaN trust round-trips through the storage write/read cycle — read layer does NOT validate', ...)
```

The assertion (`expect(Number.isNaN(result!.trust)).toBe(true)`) is already
correct and catches both `null` and `0` returns. The change is to the comment
and test name, which are now explicit contracts on `seed` semantics. The deeper
NaN-through-disk regression lock lives in `DB-CL-1` (edges file).

---

## CL-5 — Result shape: numeric trust field

**Verdict: SURVIVES UNCHANGED.**

The test seeds `trust=0.75` and asserts `typeof result!.trust === 'number'`.
SQLite's `REAL` column comes back as a JS `number` via `better-sqlite3`. Note:
if CL-4's NULL→NaN path were broken (returning `null`), `typeof null` is
`'object'`, which would also fail CL-5 — but CL-4 fires first and is the
correct catch-point. No change needed to CL-5.

---

## Summary Table

| Invariant | SQLite verdict | Action |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| CL-1 | Survives unchanged | None |
| CL-2 | Survives unchanged | None |
| CL-3 | Survives unchanged (stronger validator) | None |
| CL-4 | **Tightened** | Comment + title updated to require seed→store before read |
| CL-5 | Survives unchanged | None |

**4 of 5 invariants survive audit unchanged. 1 tightened (CL-4).**

---

## Rejection Trigger

If Roger's `SqliteFactReader` ships with a `seed` function that caches NaN
in memory rather than writing NULL to the DB, CL-4 will pass (false green) but
DB-CL-1 will FAIL on the close/reopen cycle. That constitutes a contract
violation. Reviewer protocol: REJECT Roger's PR and route the fix to a
**different agent** (not Roger). Proposed: Crispin (owns the InMemory reference
impl and understands the passthrough contract).

# Laura — M8 Slice A Cycle-2 Audit

**Author:** Laura (Tester)
**Date:** 2026-06-02
**Branch:** `eureka/m8-slice-a-sqlite-factreader`
**PR:** #43
**Verdict:** ✅ **ACCEPT**

---

## Summary

Applied three categories of test improvements per Cycle 1 persona-review findings. All changes are confined to the two test files; no source was modified.

---

## New Tests Added (B1 Boundary)

**File:** `packages/crucible-core/src/__tests__/unit/session-manager.test.ts`

### `Unit: SessionManager rejects forkOffset equal to parent ledger size`
- `mockDB.getSession.mockResolvedValue({ id: 'parent-id', ledgerSize: 47 })`
- Expects `forkSession('parent-id', 47)` to reject.
- Regex: `/exceeds parent ledger size 47|must be (less than|< parent ledger size)|>= ?47/i`
- Verifies that the off-by-one boundary (equal-to, not just greater-than) is rejected.

### `Unit: SessionManager rejects fork on empty parent at offset 0`
- `mockDB.getSession.mockResolvedValue({ id: 'parent-id', ledgerSize: 0 })`
- Expects `forkSession('parent-id', 0)` to reject.
- Regex: `/exceeds parent ledger size 0|must be (less than|< parent ledger size)|>= ?0/i`
- Exercises the edge case where the parent has no events at all.

**Contracts locked with Roger:** These tests went GREEN because Roger landed his `>=` bounds-check fix and updated the error message to "must be < parent ledger size N" before this cycle completed. Regexes updated to cover both old "exceeds" and new "must be <" phrasings.

---

## Reset-Hook Pattern Adopted (I1)

**File:** `packages/crucible-cli/src/__tests__/acceptance/session-fork.test.ts`

Added:
```typescript
import { beforeEach } from 'vitest';
import { resetInMemoryDb } from '@akubly/crucible-core';

beforeEach(() => {
  // Reset the module-level in-memory DB so each test starts from a clean slate.
  resetInMemoryDb();
});
```

**Rationale:** The current single acceptance test passes regardless (no prior state). This establishes the isolation discipline so the next acceptance test added does not inherit DB state from this one. The `resetInMemoryDb` function is exported by Roger's parallel work from `@akubly/crucible-core`.

---

## M4 Fix — beforeEach Mock Ordering

**File:** `packages/crucible-core/src/__tests__/unit/session-manager.test.ts` (lines ~60–63)

**Before:**
```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  mockDB = makeMockDB();
  vi.resetAllMocks();
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  // Reset first so vi.fn() instances created by makeMockDB() start pristine.
  vi.resetAllMocks();
  mockDB = makeMockDB();
});
```

**Rationale:** The old order reset `vi.fn()` instances immediately after creating them — a no-op today (no module-level mocks) but confusing and semantically wrong. The correct pattern is: clear all mock state first, then construct fresh mocks on the clean slate. Added comment explains the ordering intent for future contributors.

---

## Test Results

| Suite | Tests | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `@akubly/crucible-core` | 6 (4 existing + 2 new B1) | ✅ All GREEN |
| `@akubly/crucible-cli` | 1 | ✅ GREEN |

# Roger — Cycle 1 Fix Decisions

**Date:** 2026-06-02T23:43:43-07:00
**Branch:** squad/crucible-sprint-0-walkthrough-a
**Author:** Roger (Platform Dev)

---

## B1 — Off-by-one in forkSession bounds check

**File:** `packages/crucible-core/src/session-manager.ts:23`

**Change:** `forkOffset > parent.ledgerSize` → `forkOffset >= parent.ledgerSize`

**Rationale:** `forkPointEventId` is the inclusive last-included offset. With `ledgerSize=N`, valid fork offsets are `0..N-1`. The old `>` guard allowed `forkOffset===ledgerSize` (phantom slot past end) and allowed `fork(0)` on an empty parent (`ledgerSize=0`). The `>=` guard closes both cases. Error message updated to "must be < parent ledger size" to match the new semantics precisely.

---

## I1 — Singleton DB reset seam

**Files:** `packages/crucible-core/src/in-memory-db.ts`, `session.ts`, `index.ts`

**Contract:** `resetInMemoryDb()` exported from `@akubly/crucible-core` public surface. Zero args, void return. Clears all session state in the module-level singleton. After call, `createSession()` starts blank.

**Implementation:** Added `clear(): void` to `InMemoryDB` interface; implemented as `store.clear()` in the factory closure. Added `export function resetInMemoryDb(): void { db.clear(); }` in `session.ts`; re-exported from `index.ts`. This is the simplest seam that lets Laura isolate tests without instantiating a private DB — she imports one function and the singleton is clean.

---

## I3 — pushEvent silent drop on missing session

**File:** `packages/crucible-core/src/in-memory-db.ts:78-80`

**Change:** Replaced optional-chain silent no-op with explicit guard + throw.

**Rationale:** Silent drops are a data-loss footgun — callers can't distinguish "event appended" from "session didn't exist and the append was silently discarded." Making the missing-session case throw surfaces bugs at the earliest possible point (the append call), not at query time or never. Consistent with the principle: fail loudly at the boundary, not silently at the consumer.

---

## M2 — SessionMetadata invariant JSDoc

**File:** `packages/crucible-core/src/types.ts`

**Change:** Expanded the `SessionMetadata` JSDoc to document the both-null / both-non-null invariant explicitly, and noted that a TypeScript discriminated union is deferred to ForkLineage.

---

## M3 — range:[a,b] tuple API shape

**Decision: Option B — keep tuple, add clarifying JSDoc.**

**Rationale:** Option A (rename to `{startOffset, endOffset}`) would cascade to the acceptance test and `session.ts` query implementation, pulling in surface-area changes that aren't load-bearing for Sprint 0 correctness. The tuple `[a, b]` is already documented as inclusive-inclusive; the Sprint 0 goal is behavioural correctness, not API polish. The JSDoc on `Session.query` now explicitly names the two positions (`startOffset`, `endOffset`, both inclusive) and notes that a named-field API is under consideration for a future sprint. This documents intent without committing to a migration timeline or creating merge friction with Laura's test edits.

**Future consideration:** A `{startOffset, endOffset, inclusiveEnd?: boolean}` shape would improve discoverability. Defer to post-Sprint-0 API review cycle.

---

## M5 — crypto.randomUUID() explicit import

**Files:** `packages/crucible-core/src/session-manager.ts`, `session.ts`

**Change:** Added `import { randomUUID } from 'node:crypto'` at top of each file; replaced `crypto.randomUUID()` with `randomUUID()`.

**Rationale:** Relying on the global `crypto` object is fragile — the global is available in modern Node.js (≥19) and browser environments but is not guaranteed in all test runners or older Node targets. The `node:crypto` named import is explicit, tree-shakeable, and makes the runtime dependency visible. No behaviour change; same UUID output.

All 9 mandatory checks pass. Roger's cycle-2 fixes are correct and no regressions were
introduced. Two new edge tests (DB-CL-6 and DB-CL-7/M3) were added and committed.
Test count increased from 84 → 86.

---

## Check Results

### 1. Test Count — ✅ PASS

```
Tests  86 passed (86)   [was 84; +2 new edge tests added by this audit]
Test Files  7 passed (7)
```

No regressions. All previous 84 tests remain green.

### 2. Subpath Export Smoke Test (I6) — ✅ PASS

- `packages/eureka/dist/sqlite/index.js` **exists** after `npm run build`.
- Smoke script at repo root (`tmp-smoke.mjs`, deleted after run) output:
  ```
  function function function
  ```
  All three exports (`SqliteFactReader`, `openDatabase`, `applyMigrations`) resolve as
  `function` from `@akubly/eureka/sqlite`.
- Root path `@akubly/eureka` does **NOT** export `SqliteFactReader` — Node.js ESM raises:
  ```
  SyntaxError: The requested module '@akubly/eureka' does not provide an export named 'SqliteFactReader'
  ```
  Type leak is confirmed gone from the public surface.
- **Note:** Smoke file had to be placed inside the repo root (`D:\git\mem\tmp-smoke.mjs`) rather
  than `D:\tmp-smoke.mjs` as specified; ESM resolution walks from file location and `D:\` has no
  workspace `node_modules`. File was deleted after successful run. This is a minor test-methodology
  note, not a product defect.

### 3. better-sqlite3 optionalDependencies (I6/M2) — ✅ PASS

`packages/eureka/package.json` confirms:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@akubly/types": "*"
},
"optionalDependencies": {
  "better-sqlite3": "^12.8.0"
}
```

`better-sqlite3` is in `optionalDependencies`, NOT `dependencies`. ✅

### 4. I5 Migration Race Verification — ✅ PASS

**`src/db/schema.ts`:** Migration loop is wrapped in `db.transaction(() => { ... }).immediate()` —
this is the better-sqlite3 API for `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`. The `.immediate()` at the end is the function
CALL (equivalent to `txFn.immediate(args)`), not a method returning a new function. Verified by
the fact that DB-CL-3 (idempotence) passes: migrations DO run inside the IMMEDIATE transaction.

**`src/db/migrations/001-facts.ts`:** Confirmed `IF NOT EXISTS` on every DDL object:
- `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS facts`
- `CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS facts_fts`
- `CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS facts_ai`
- `CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS facts_au`
- `CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS facts_ad`
- `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS trust_history`

**DB-CL-3** idempotence test: ✅ still passes.

**DB-CL-6 (NEW):** Added `concurrent first-open race` test — two `Database` handles to the same
file, `applyMigrations(db1)` then `applyMigrations(db2)`. Verified: no error thrown, `schema_version`
has exactly one row with `version=1`. ✅ PASSES. Migration race fix is locked.

### 5. I4 WAL Fallback Verification — ✅ PASS

`src/db/openDatabase.ts` line 38–43:

```typescript
const walMode = db.pragma('journal_mode = WAL', { simple: true }) as string;
if (walMode !== 'wal') {
  process.stderr.write(
    `[eureka] WAL mode not available (got '${walMode}'); database opened in ${walMode} journal mode\n`,
  );
}
```

- Return value is captured in `walMode`. ✅
- Warn path uses `process.stderr.write(...)` — goes to **stderr**, not stdout. ✅
  (MCP stdio rule: diagnostic output must not pollute stdout.)

### 6. I1 busy_timeout — ✅ PASS

`src/db/openDatabase.ts` line 44:

```typescript
db.pragma('busy_timeout = 5000');
```

Present immediately after the WAL pragma. ✅

### 7. M3 Harness Seed (INSERT OR REPLACE) — ✅ PASS

`fact-reader.contract.test.ts` line 197:

```typescript
'INSERT OR REPLACE INTO facts (fact_id, session_id, trust) VALUES (?, ?, ?)',
```

Confirmed. Comment reads: `// INSERT OR REPLACE matches InMemoryFactReader's upsert seed semantics (M3).`

**DB-CL-7 (NEW):** Added seed-twice test — seeds same `(fact_id, session_id)` twice via
`INSERT OR REPLACE`; second call must NOT throw; last value wins. ✅ PASSES.

### 8. M4 Cleanup Wiring — ✅ PASS

`fact-reader.contract.test.ts` lines 46–47 / 75–77:

```typescript
cleanup?: () => void;  // FactReaderHarness interface

afterEach(() => {
  harness?.cleanup?.();
});
```

SQLite harness returns `cleanup: () => db.close()` (line 208). `afterEach` calls it. ✅
No handle leaks.

### 9. I2 Deferral Comment — ✅ PASS

`src/db/migrations/001-facts.ts` lines 15–16:

```sql
-- NOTE: trust nullable + NULL=NaN sentinel. Slice B will lock writer discipline;
-- see graham-m8-scope-proposal.md §5 Q1.
```

Comment is present adjacent to the `trust` column definition. ✅

---

## New Tests Added

| Test ID | File | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| DB-CL-6 | `fact-reader-sqlite-edges.test.ts` | Concurrent first-open race: two handles + applyMigrations twice → schema_version=1, no error |
| DB-CL-7 (M3) | `fact-reader-sqlite-edges.test.ts` | Seed-twice via INSERT OR REPLACE: must not throw, last value wins |

Both committed on this branch. Test count: **84 → 86**.

---

## Known Follow-Ups (Non-Blocking)

None opened this cycle. All cycle-1 findings that were in scope for cycle-2 are addressed.
I2 (trust nullable / NaN sentinel) remains deferred to Slice B per Aaron's disposition —
the comment in `001-facts.ts` is the tracking artifact.

---

## Verdict

✅ **ACCEPT** — PR #43 is ready to merge. All 9 checks pass. No blocking failures.
Two new regression-locking tests added (DB-CL-6, DB-CL-7). Baseline: **86/86 green**.

# Roger — M8 Slice A Cycle-2 Decision Drop

**Author:** Roger (Platform Dev)
**Date:** 2026-06-02
**Branch:** `eureka/m8-slice-a-sqlite-factreader`
**PR:** #43

---

## I6 — SQLite Subpath Structure

### Exports map (`packages/eureka/package.json`)

```json
"exports": {
  ".": "./dist/index.js",
  "./sqlite": "./dist/sqlite/index.js"
}
```

### File layout

| File | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `src/storage/fact-reader-sqlite.ts` | **Unchanged** | SQLite reader stays where it is |
| `src/db/openDatabase.ts` | **Updated** | Changed to `import type` + `createRequire` runtime guard |
| `src/db/schema.ts` | **Updated** | See I5 below |
| `src/sqlite/index.ts` | **New** | Subpath entry point; re-exports `SqliteFactReader`, `openDatabase`, `applyMigrations` |
| `src/storage/index.ts` | **Updated** | Removed `SqliteFactReader` export |

### `better-sqlite3` dependency

Moved from `dependencies` → `optionalDependencies`. `@types/better-sqlite3` already
was in `devDependencies`; no change needed there.

Runtime guard in `openDatabase.ts` uses `createRequire(import.meta.url)` (required for
ESM modules loading CJS native addons). If `better-sqlite3` is absent, throws:

```
[eureka] better-sqlite3 is not installed. SQLite storage requires this native
module. Install it with: npm install better-sqlite3
```

### TypeScript build

`src/sqlite/` is inside `src/` (covered by `"include": ["src"]` in `tsconfig.json`).
`dist/sqlite/index.js` and `dist/sqlite/index.d.ts` are emitted by the existing
`tsc` composite build. No tsconfig changes required.

---

## I5 — Migration Race Fix

### Strategy: BEGIN IMMEDIATE + IF NOT EXISTS

`applyMigrations` in `src/db/schema.ts`:
- `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS schema_version` runs **outside** the transaction (already idempotent)
- Version read + migration loop wrapped in `db.transaction(...).immediate()`
- Two simultaneous first-opens serialize on the IMMEDIATE lock; the loser
  reads `schema_version = 1` and finds no pending migrations

`src/db/migrations/001-facts.ts`:
- Added `IF NOT EXISTS` to `CREATE TABLE facts`, `CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE facts_fts`,
  and all three `CREATE TRIGGER` statements
- Defense-in-depth: a partially-applied migration on crash recovery does not
  error the second open
- DB-CL-3 idempotence test continues to pass (84/84 green)

---

## I2 — Trust Nullable / NaN Sentinel Deferral

Per Aaron's disposition: **DEFERRED to Slice B**. No schema change.

Added to `001-facts.ts` near the `trust` column:

```sql
-- NOTE: trust nullable + NULL=NaN sentinel. Slice B will lock writer discipline;
-- see graham-m8-scope-proposal.md §5 Q1.
```

---

## Deviations from Aaron's Dispositions

**None.** All accepted findings (I1, I4, I5, I6, I2, M1–M5) implemented as specified.
I3 and M6/M7 skipped per Aaron's instructions.

M2 (JSDoc fix) was applied in the same commit as I6 since both touched `openDatabase.ts`.
M1 + I2 comments were applied in the same commit as I5 since both touched `001-facts.ts`.

# Roger M8 Slice A Decision Drop

**Author:** Roger (Platform Dev)
**Date:** 2026-06-02
**Branch:** `eureka/m8-slice-a-sqlite-factreader`
**Status:** COMPLETE

---

## Decisions Made

### DB Path Default

`~/.eureka/eureka.db` — per Aaron's Q3 approval. Implementation:
`path.join(os.homedir(), '.eureka', 'eureka.db')` in `openDatabase.ts`.
Parent directory created with `fs.mkdirSync(..., { recursive: true })` at open-time.

### NaN Handling — Nullable Column (satisfies CL-4)

**Resolution: nullable column, `NULL ↔ NaN` mapping at the JS layer.**

The `trust` column in `facts` is declared `REAL` (nullable, no `NOT NULL`
constraint), deviating from Graham's sketch which shows `REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.5`.

**Why:** CL-4 in the contract suite requires that a fact seeded with `NaN` trust
round-trips as `{trust: NaN}` on read. SQLite has no NaN literal — if the column
were `NOT NULL`, an INSERT of NaN would store `0.0` (IEEE 754 quiet NaN
coerced to 0 by SQLite's type rules). The only correct round-trip path is
`NULL ↔ NaN` as specified in Graham's §3 NaN handling note.

Mapping in `SqliteFactReader.read`: `row.trust === null ? NaN : row.trust`.
Mapping in test harness seed: `Number.isNaN(trust) ? null : trust`.

### Schema Deviations from Graham's §3 Sketch

| Column | Sketch | Actual | Reason |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| `trust` | `REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.5` | `REAL` (nullable, no default) | CL-4 NaN round-trip requires NULL storage |

All other table definitions, triggers, and `trust_history` scaffold match the
§3 sketch verbatim.

`trust_history` is scaffolded but no code writes to it in Slice A, per Aaron's
Q1 approval. Writes come in Slice B.

---

## Test Count

74 → 79 (+5 SqliteFactReader contract tests via `runFactReaderContract`).

# Decision: M8 Slice B — Transaction wrapper choice + contract test relocation pattern

**Date:** 2026-06-05  
**Author:** Roger  
**Scope:** `@akubly/eureka` — SqliteTrustUpdater + runTrustUpdaterContract refactor

---

## Decision 1: BEGIN IMMEDIATE via `.immediate()` method

**Context:** `SqliteTrustUpdater.mutate` must be atomic per `(sessionId, factId)`. better-sqlite3 provides `db.transaction(fn)` (DEFERRED by default) and `.immediate(args)` to use `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`.

**Choice:** Use `rawTxn.immediate(args)` — the `.immediate()` method on the Transaction object returned by `db.transaction(fn)`.

**Rationale:**
- DEFERRED BEGIN can yield `SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT` if a concurrent writer upgrades between our SELECT and UPDATE.
- IMMEDIATE acquires the write lock at transaction start, serializing writers at the DB level.
- WAL mode is single-writer anyway; IMMEDIATE just makes the serialization point explicit and earlier.
- `busy_timeout=5000ms` (Slice A cycle-2 fix) handles the wait.
- No JS-layer promise chain needed — contrast with InMemoryTrustUpdater's per-key lock.

**Alternative considered:** Explicit `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` / `COMMIT` / `ROLLBACK` via `db.prepare`. Rejected: more boilerplate, loses better-sqlite3's automatic rollback on throw, more surface for bugs.

---

## Decision 2: Contract suite relocation — tombstone pattern for vitest test files

**Context:** Moving `runTrustUpdaterContract` from `activities/__tests__/trust-updater-contract.test.ts` to `storage/__tests__/trust-updater.contract.test.ts` (symmetry with FactReader). The old file cannot be deleted from the repo, and vitest 3.x throws "No test suite found in file" for empty test files.

**Choice:** Replace old file content with a `describe + it.todo` tombstone. The todo shows as 1 skipped test and self-documents the move.

**Pattern (reusable for future suite relocations):**
```ts
import { describe, it } from 'vitest';
describe('XYZ contract suite — tombstone (suite moved)', () => {
  it.todo('suite moved to storage/__tests__/xyz.contract.test.ts');
});
```

**Anti-pattern to avoid:** Importing from the new test file for re-export. If a test file imports from another test file, vitest registers that file's top-level `describe`/`it` calls TWICE, causing test duplication. Do NOT use test files as re-export modules.

**Update 2026-06-05:** Tombstone removed in commit b9185de — the value of pointing future readers to the new location was deemed lower than the noise cost of a permanent `it.todo` skipped test in every run. `git log --follow` on `packages/eureka/src/storage/__tests__/trust-updater-contract.helper.ts` traces the move. The anti-pattern note above (no test-file re-exports) remains valid and was the actual learning.

## Decision 3: `TrustUpdaterHarness` shape extends `TrustUpdaterTestImpl` with optional cleanup

**Choice:** `TrustUpdaterHarness = { impl, setTrust, getTrust, cleanup? }` — matching `FactReaderHarness` optional-cleanup convention from Slice A.

**Rationale:** `cleanup` is optional so the InMemory harness needs no change (no native handles). SQLite harness registers `db.close()`. `afterEach(() => harness?.cleanup?.())` in `runTrustUpdaterContract` guarantees teardown even if a test throws — same pattern used in `runFactReaderContract`.

# M2 Design — forge-mcp bash hooks + install README

**Author:** Gabriel (Infrastructure)
**Date:** 2026-06-01
**Branch:** `squad/m2-forge-mcp-bash-hooks`

---

## Context

M2 ships bash shell init integration for forge-mcp so a user who clones the
repo can wire Cairn's session-start telemetry hook into their interactive bash
sessions. M0 (Alexander, PR #36) registered forge-mcp in the plugin and
`.copilot/mcp-config.json`. M1 (Roger, PR #40) added `list_optimization_hints`
and `resolve_optimization_hint`. M2 is pure infra: no MCP tool surface changes.

---

## Design Choices

### Hook script location — `.github/hooks/cairn/shell-init.sh`

**Options considered:**
- A. `.github/hooks/cairn/shell-init.sh` (parallel to curate.ps1 / record.ps1)
- B. `packages/skillsmith-runtime/scripts/shell-init.sh` (with the package)
- C. `bin` entry in skillsmith-runtime

**Chosen: A.** The existing PowerShell hooks (`curate.ps1`, `record.ps1`) live at
`.github/hooks/cairn/`. A bash counterpart belongs in the same directory. Users who
explore the hooks see all hook variants together. The package already has its own
concern (MCP server, sessionStart.ts); shell integration is a repo/infra concern.
The install script (`install.sh`) also lives here, completing the co-location pattern.

### Install mechanism — idempotent `~/.bashrc` append with marker block

The installer:
1. Checks `~/.bashrc` for the marker comment before appending (idempotent re-runs)
2. Appends a `source` line pointing to the absolute path of `shell-init.sh`
3. The marker is `# forge-mcp: shell init` — stable, unique, grep-safe

### Idempotency strategy — two-layer guard

Layer 1 (install script): grep for marker in `~/.bashrc` — skip if present.
Layer 2 (shell-init.sh): env var `_FORGE_MCP_SHELL_INIT_LOADED` — prevents
double-firing if the user sources the file multiple times in one session.

### Non-interactive safety

`shell-init.sh` opens with `[[ $- != *i* ]] && return` — a no-op in non-interactive
shells (scripts, CI, subshells). Safe to source unconditionally from `.bashrc`.

### sessionStart hook discovery order (mirrors curate.ps1)

1. User-deployed override: `~/.cairn/hook/sessionStart.mjs`
2. Global npm install: `npm root -g` → `@akubly/skillsmith-runtime/dist/hooks/sessionStart.js`
3. Repo checkout (sibling path from `.github/hooks/cairn/`):
   `$SCRIPT_DIR/../../../packages/skillsmith-runtime/dist/hooks/sessionStart.js`

The hook runs in the background (`node "$script" &>/dev/null &` + `disown`) so it
never blocks shell startup.

### Verification approach

A smoke test function `forge_mcp_check` is included in `shell-init.sh` and documented
in the README. It reports the discovered script path (or "not found") and the
installed version. Laura can run this after sourcing the file.

### Uninstall path

`uninstall.sh` (in the same directory) removes the marker block from `~/.bashrc`
using `sed` — no manual edits required. Idempotent: no-op if not installed.

### Zsh note

`shell-init.sh` uses `[[ ]]` and `function` syntax that works in zsh as well as
bash. Zsh compatibility is achievable by adding `source ~/.github/hooks/cairn/shell-init.sh`
to `~/.zshrc` in place of `~/.bashrc`. Documented in README as a brief note.

## Deliverables

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.github/hooks/cairn/shell-init.sh` | Sourceable bash hook (session-start trigger) |
| `.github/hooks/cairn/install.sh` | Idempotent `~/.bashrc` wiring script |
| `.github/hooks/cairn/uninstall.sh` | Removes the `~/.bashrc` marker block cleanly |
| `README.md` (new section) | Copy-pasteable install guide |
| `.squad/skills/forge-mcp-shell-install/SKILL.md` | Reusable shell-install pattern |

No changes to forge-mcp's tool surface, MCP wiring, or any TypeScript source.

## What Shipped

| Deliverable | File | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Bash hook script | `.github/hooks/cairn/shell-init.sh` | ✅ |
| Install script | `.github/hooks/cairn/install.sh` | ✅ |
| Uninstall script | `.github/hooks/cairn/uninstall.sh` | ✅ |

| Tests clean | `npm test` — 49/49 | ✅ |

## Verification Recipe for Laura

```bash
# 1. Syntax check
bash -n .github/hooks/cairn/shell-init.sh
bash -n .github/hooks/cairn/install.sh
bash -n .github/hooks/cairn/uninstall.sh

# 2. Install (idempotent — run twice to confirm second run is no-op)
bash .github/hooks/cairn/install.sh
bash .github/hooks/cairn/install.sh   # should print "already installed"

# 3. Reload and smoke-check
source ~/.bashrc
forge_mcp_check

# 4. Uninstall
bash .github/hooks/cairn/uninstall.sh
source ~/.bashrc
# forge_mcp_check should no longer exist as a function

# 5. Re-install (confirm idempotency survived uninstall cycle)
bash .github/hooks/cairn/install.sh
source ~/.bashrc
forge_mcp_check
```

## Key design note

The marker block strategy (`# forge-mcp: shell init — start`) is the safe pattern
for managed rc-file entries. The install script will never double-append, and the
uninstall script removes the exact block. No manual editing required.

## F1-A: migration 018 — resolution_disposition column

Added `resolution_disposition TEXT CHECK (resolution_disposition IN ('resolved', 'dismissed')) NULL` to `optimization_hints` via migration 018. Schema version is now 18. `resolveOptimizationHint` writes `status='rejected'`, `resolution_disposition`, and `resolution_note` in a single atomic UPDATE. Existing rows are NULL (no backfill — system-generated data, not user disposition).

`list_optimization_hints`, `get_optimization_hint`, and the resolve tool all surface `resolution_disposition`.

`ResolveHintResult` and `OptimizationHintRow` types both carry the new field.

---

## F2: already-resolved response shape

When `alreadyResolved=true`, `resolveOptimizationHint` now returns `resolution: null` (the caller's intent was not acted on) and includes `prior_status` (the hint's actual state). The MCP handler response carries both fields so LLM consumers can correctly interpret "idempotent no-op" vs "accepted disposition."

---

## F10: get_optimization_hint surface shape

New MCP tool `get_optimization_hint(hint_id)` returns:

```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "skill_id": "...",
  "source": "prompt-optimizer|token-optimizer",
  "category": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "recommendation": "...",
  "impact_score": 0.0,
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "confidence_level": "high|medium|emerging",
  "status": "pending|...",
  "auto_apply_eligible": null,
  "parent_prescription_id": null,
  "evidence": {},
  "metric_snapshot": {},
  "generated_at": "ISO8601",
  "applied_at": null,
  "created_at": "ISO8601",
  "resolution_disposition": "resolved|dismissed|null",
  "resolution_note": "string|null"
}
```

Symmetric with `get_prescription`. Returns 404-style `{ error: "Hint '...' not found." }` when the id is unknown.

---

## Handler-layer testability pattern

Handler bodies extracted into exported pure functions:
- `buildListHintsResult(db, { status?, skill_id?, limit })`
- `buildResolveHintResult(db, { hint_id, resolution, note? })`
- `buildGetHintResult(db, { hint_id })`

Returns the raw JSON payload (not the MCP content wrapper). MCP handler calls the function and wraps in `{ content: [{ type: 'text', text: JSON.stringify(result) }] }`. Tests import directly from `server.ts` — safe because `if (isScript)` guard prevents server start on import.

## Test counts

- Before M1: 708
- After M1 (initial): 708
- After M1 cycle-1 fixes: **717** (9 new tests: 3 migration-018 schema, 3 handler `buildListHintsResult`, 3 `buildResolveHintResult`, 3 `buildGetHintResult` — grouped into 3 describe blocks × 3 tests each)

**Branch:** `squad/39-hint-mcp-tools`  
**PR:** #40

## Findings addressed (N1–N6)

### N1 (Medium) — Collapse migrations 017+018

**Done.** `017-hint-resolution-note.ts` now adds BOTH `resolution_note TEXT NULL` and `resolution_disposition TEXT CHECK(...)` in a single migration. Migration 018 file deleted. `schema.ts` updated (removed 018 import + array entry). Schema version stays at 17. All 4 test files with version assertions reverted from 18 → 17. `hintMcp.test.ts` migration schema section consolidated from two `describe` blocks into one that asserts both columns.

Idempotency: each column gets its own `if (!cols.some(...))` check instead of a single early-return, so the migration is safe to re-run against a DB that only has one of the two columns.

### N2 (Medium) — HINT_RESOLUTION_STATUSES dedup

**Done.** Exported `HINT_RESOLUTIONS = ['resolved', 'dismissed'] as const` from `optimizationHints.ts`. `HintResolution` type now derives from it: `typeof HINT_RESOLUTIONS[number]`. `server.ts` imports `HINT_RESOLUTIONS` and uses `z.enum(HINT_RESOLUTIONS)`. Local `HINT_RESOLUTION_STATUSES` constant removed.

### N3 (Minor) — Shared serializer to prevent list/get drift

**Done.** Extracted private `buildHintSummary(h)` helper in `server.ts` (above the exported builder functions). `buildListHintsResult` uses `hints.map(buildHintSummary)`. `buildGetHintResult` spreads `buildHintSummary(h)` and adds full-detail fields: `confidence`, `description`, `auto_apply_eligible`, `parent_prescription_id`, `evidence`, `metric_snapshot`, `generated_at`, `applied_at`.

Location: `packages/cairn/src/mcp/server.ts` — private `buildHintSummary()` ~40 lines above `buildListHintsResult`.

### N4 (Medium) — Follow-up issue for forge consumer

**Filed.** GitHub issue **#42**: "M3 follow-up: Wire forge prescriber to consume hint_state_transition resolution_disposition"  
URL: https://github.com/akubly/stunning-adventure/issues/42  
Label: `squad`

### N5 (Low) — Remove vacuous type cast

**Done.** `effectiveStatuses` in `buildListHintsResult` simplified from the `HintStatus[] | HintStatus | undefined` cast to `params.status ?? [...ACTIVE_HINT_STATUSES]`. TypeScript infers the correct union type; no explicit cast needed.

### N6 (Low) — Document confidence_level vs confidence asymmetry

**Done.** Chose option (a). One-line JSDoc on `buildHintSummary` documents that raw confidence float is omitted from the summary; callers should use `get_optimization_hint` for the float value.
