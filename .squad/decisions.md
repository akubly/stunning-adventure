# Squad Decisions

## Active Decisions

### W2-1: ChangeVectorSummary Category Field (Roger)

**Scope:** Type consolidation for shared `ChangeVectorSummary` contract

**Decision:** Use stricter `OptimizationCategory` union (six-value string union from Forge) for `category` field in canonical `@akubly/types` definition.

**Rationale:** Forge already encodes the domain's real category set. Making the union canonical now ensures type safety for W2-2/W2-7 follow-on work while remaining additive (no existing duplicates switched yet).

**Impact:** Both Forge and Cairn gain shared, stricter type contract; future category additions go through Forge's enum.

### W2-7: Category Narrowing at SQLite Boundary (Rosella)

**Scope:** Cairn data layer type safety for ChangeVectorSummary contract

**Decision:** Narrow raw `optimization_hints.category` strings at Cairn's SQLite read boundary instead of widening the shared contract back to `string`.

**Implementation:** `getAllCategories()` filters DB values through the canonical `OptimizationCategory` union from `@akubly/types`. `summarizeChangeVectors()` only accepts narrowed categories. `SqliteChangeVectorProvider.getSummaries()` drops summaries where `vectorCount === 0`.

**Rationale:** DB schema remains permissive for backward compatibility, but cross-package `ChangeVectorSummary` contract is strict. Narrowing once at boundary keeps rest of Cairn aligned with Forge's canonical union without unsafe casts. Zero-vector summaries provide no historical signal and trigger Phase 4.5 fallback mode.

**Impact:** Cairn data layer now type-safe; empty summaries filtered at provider output.
