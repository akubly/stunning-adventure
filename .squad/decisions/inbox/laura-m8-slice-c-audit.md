# Audit — Laura M8 Slice C (SqliteFactStore + FTS5 BM25 Search)

**Author:** Laura (Tester)
**Date:** 2026-06-05
**Branch:** `eureka/m8-slice-c-factstore`
**PR:** #48
**Verdict:** ✅ ACCEPT-WITH-FOLLOWUPS

---

## Baseline Verified

- Checked out `eureka/m8-slice-c-factstore`, pulled FF-only. Branch was already at `643f106` (Roger's drop).
- `npm test` (packages/eureka): **109 tests, 8 files, all green**. Matches Roger's claimed count.
- `npm run build` (packages/eureka): **clean** (tsc, no errors).

## Audit Areas & Findings

### 1. BM25 Ordering — Critical Regression Lock

**Status: PASS.** Roger's `ORDER BY (-bm25(facts_fts)) * f.trust DESC` is correct.

Sign analysis:
- `bm25()` returns NEGATIVE (more-negative = better match)
- `-bm25(...)` flips to positive (larger = better)
- Multiplied by `trust ∈ [0,1]` gives composite score, still positive
- `DESC` orders highest composite first = best matches first

FS-4 in the contract suite locks this: seeds two facts with different term frequencies (3× vs 1×) and asserts the higher-frequency fact ranks first. If the negation were dropped (`bm25()` used directly with DESC), best matches would appear LAST (most-negative = "largest" in signed comparison = first in DESC, which is wrong). FS-4 catches this.

**Normalization**: `normalizeRelevance()` correctly flips sign then applies min-max. Top result always gets `relevance = 1.0`. The all-equal branch (`max === min → 1.0`) handles single-result and identical-score cases.

**Per-page normalization note (non-blocking):** Roger's decision drop §2 acknowledges that relevance scores are not comparable across pages. A sole result on page 2 gets `relevance = 1.0` even if it's a weak match. This is intentional for v1 (single-page recall). Locked in FS-SE-12.

### 2. Cursor Pagination

**Status: PASS.** FS-5 in the contract suite already covers the 3-page round-trip (disjoint, complete, no nextCursor on final page). My FS-SE-3/4 add:

- **Garbage cursor (FS-SE-3)**: Invalid base64 decodes to non-JSON, `catch` block returns 0. Verified by comparing with no-cursor baseline — results are identical.
- **Negative offset (FS-SE-4)**: `{ offset: -5 }` → `payload.offset >= 0` fails → returns 0. Correct guard.

**Concurrent-insert caveat** (non-blocking, document only): Offset cursors can skip or repeat rows if facts are inserted between page fetches. This is a known limitation of offset-based pagination, acknowledged in Roger's decision drop §3 and the code comments. Not a blocker for single-writer v1; flagged as Slice D+ concern.

**limit=0 degenerate case** (VERY LOW, note only): Calling `search({ limit: 0 })` directly (not via `recallWithScores`, which guards k=0 before touching FactStore) would loop: `hasMore = (1 row > 0) = true`, `nextCursor = encodeCursor(0)`. Not reachable through the normal activity path; no action required.

### 3. minTrust Floor at SQL Layer

**Status: PASS.** All boundary cases:

| Trust | minTrust | Expected | Result |
|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| 0.15 | 0.15 | INCLUDED | ✅ FS-SE-5 |
| 0.149 | 0.15 | EXCLUDED | ✅ FS-SE-6 |
| NULL | 0 | EXCLUDED | ✅ FS-SE-7 |
| 0.14 | (omitted, default 0.15) | EXCLUDED | ✅ FS-SE-8 |
| 0.0 | 0 | INCLUDED | ✅ FS-SE-7 (confirms trust=0 ≠ NULL) |

The WHERE clause `f.trust IS NOT NULL AND f.trust >= $min_trust` correctly sequences the NULL check before the >= comparison, so NULL trust is excluded at any floor including 0.

### 4. Session Isolation

**Status: PASS.** FS-6 in the contract suite covers this with a direct assertion. Roger's `AND f.session_id = $session_id` on every query ensures facts never bleed across session boundaries. The session is a `$`-param, not string-interpolated, so SQL injection is not a concern.

### 5. Empty / Degenerate Queries

**Status: PASS WITH FINDING.**

- Whitespace-only query (`"   "`, `"\t"`, etc.): short-circuited by `if (!query.trim())` before FTS5. Returns `{ results: [] }`. ✅ FS-SE-9.
- Single result → no nextCursor. ✅ FS-SE-10.
- **FINDING FSE-1 (MEDIUM): FTS5 syntax characters not sanitized.** Queries containing FTS5 operator characters (unclosed `"`, bare `AND`/`OR` operators) propagate as rejected Promises rather than graceful empty results. `stmt.all()` is synchronous; the error becomes a rejection of the async `search()` return value. FS-SE-11 locks this current behavior. Recommend: wrap `stmt.all()` in try/catch; on FTS5 parse error, return `{ results: [] }`. This is MEDIUM — not a data corruption issue, but any user-supplied query string reaching `search()` is a potential crash path.

### 6. Interface Reconciliation / recall Consumer

**Status: PASS.** `recallWithScores` correctly destructures `{ results: candidates }` from `factStore.search()`. All 18 recall tests pass. The `cursor` parameter in `FactStore.search()` is optional and not used by `recallWithScores` (which does a single-page overfetch). No regression.

## Edge Tests Added

File: `packages/eureka/src/storage/__tests__/fact-store-sqlite-edges.test.ts`
Committed on branch as `f08c746`, pushed to PR #48.

| ID | What it locks |
|----|---------------|
| FS-SE-1 | BM25 normalization: top result `relevance=1.0`, descending order, all ∈ [0,1] |
| FS-SE-2 | Single match: `relevance=1.0` (all-equal branch in normalizeRelevance) |
| FS-SE-3 | Garbage cursor: safe fallback to offset=0, no crash |
| FS-SE-4 | Negative-offset cursor: guard `>= 0` fires, fallback to 0 |
| FS-SE-5 | minTrust exact floor: `trust=0.15` with `minTrust=0.15` is INCLUDED |
| FS-SE-6 | minTrust just-below: `trust=0.149` excluded at `minTrust=0.15` |
| FS-SE-7 | NULL trust excluded even at `minTrust=0`; `trust=0` IS allowed at `minTrust=0` |
| FS-SE-8 | Default `minTrust=0.15` when omitted: `trust=0.14` excluded |
| FS-SE-9 | Whitespace-only query: empty results, no crash (4 variants) |
| FS-SE-10 | Final page: `nextCursor` absent |
| FS-SE-11 | FTS5 unclosed-quote rejects — documents FINDING FSE-1 |
| FS-SE-12 | Per-page normalization distortion: sole page-2 result gets `relevance=1.0` |

## Follow-up Items (Non-Blocking)

These do NOT block acceptance. File in backlog:

| ID | Severity | Description |
|----|----------|-------------|
| FSE-1 | MEDIUM | Wrap `stmt.all()` in try/catch in `SqliteFactStore.search()`; FTS5 parse errors should return `{ results: [] }` rather than rejecting. Any user-supplied query string is a crash surface. |
| FSE-2 | LOW | Offset cursor gaps/dupes under concurrent inserts — document in `FactStore` interface JSDoc. Non-issue for single-writer v1; relevant before cross-session queries (Slice D+). |
| FSE-3 | LOW | `search({ limit: 0 })` degenerate: nextCursor encodes offset=0, creating a potential pagination loop. Add `if (limit <= 0) return { results: [] }` guard. Not reachable via normal activity path. |
| FSE-4 | NOTE | Cross-page relevance incomparability — documented in FS-SE-12. Roger to add a note to `FactStore.search()` interface JSDoc that `relevance` is per-page only. |

## Contract Invariant Note for Roger

One invariant belongs in the shared contract helper (applies to ALL FactStore impls), but I am NOT editing `fact-store-contract.helper.ts` directly per the audit mandate. **Roger to add:**

> **FS-7 (proposed)**: A fact with `trust=NULL` (NaN sentinel per CL-4) MUST never appear in search results regardless of `minTrust`. The `seed` helper in the contract fixture intentionally writes only valid `number` trust values; NULL must be tested via an impl-specific side-channel that bypasses `seed`. Note this in the helper's contract invariant list.

## Final State

- **Test count:** 109 → **121** (+12 edge tests)
- **Build:** ✅ clean (`tsc`, no errors)
- **All 9 test files pass**

## Verdict

**✅ ACCEPT-WITH-FOLLOWUPS**

Roger's Slice C is correct and well-structured. The BM25 sign convention is right, cursor safety is solid, minTrust boundaries are precise, and session isolation holds. The one genuine finding (FSE-1: no FTS5 input sanitization) is MEDIUM severity — it's a real crash path for user-supplied queries, but not a correctness, isolation, or data-loss issue. It does not block the slice. Filed as a follow-up with a test that locks current behavior.
