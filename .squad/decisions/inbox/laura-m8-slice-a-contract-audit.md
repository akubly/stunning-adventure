# M8 Slice A — FactReader Contract Audit

**Author:** Laura (Tester)
**Date:** 2026-06-01
**Branch:** `eureka/m8-slice-a-sqlite-factreader`
**Status:** COMPLETE — audit filed, CL-4 tightened, edge test file committed

---

## Purpose

Audit CL-1 through CL-5 in `fact-reader.contract.test.ts` for SQLite-semantic
completeness before Roger's `SqliteFactReader` impl is declared done. SQLite
introduces real serialization/deserialization (NaN→NULL, WAL on-disk state,
shared DB file for all sessions) that the in-memory impl trivially sidesteps.
Each invariant below states whether it survives SQLite semantics unchanged, and
if not, what was tightened.

---

## CL-1 — Happy Path: seeded fact is readable

**Verdict: SURVIVES UNCHANGED.**

The test seeds `trust=0.5` and asserts `{trust: 0.5}`. SQLite's `REAL` column
stores IEEE 754 doubles; `0.5` is exactly representable and round-trips without
rounding error. The SQL query `WHERE fact_id = ? AND session_id = ?` maps
directly to the M8 schema's columns. No SQLite-specific failure mode here. The
test will exercise the full INSERT→SELECT cycle once Roger's harness `seed`
writes via raw SQL (or an internal method) and `reader.read()` queries the DB.

---

## CL-2 — Missing fact returns null (not undefined)

**Verdict: SURVIVES UNCHANGED.**

The test reads a factId that was never seeded and asserts `expect(result).toBeNull()`.
For SQLite, a `SELECT` that matches zero rows returns no rows; the impl maps that
to `null`. Vitest's `toBeNull()` is strict — it rejects `undefined`. The test
will catch both "returns undefined" and "throws on miss" bugs. No special
handling needed.

---

## CL-3 — Session isolation: wrong-session reads return null

**Verdict: SURVIVES UNCHANGED — and is a STRONGER validator for SQLite than for InMemory.**

The in-memory impl uses a `Map<factId, FactRecord[]>` scoped per-process; an
off-by-one on session filtering is contained in the JS heap. For SQLite, both
sessionA and sessionB share a **single DB file**. The `UNIQUE(fact_id,
session_id)` constraint means `(factA, sessionA)` and `(factA, sessionB)` are
distinct rows — but a SQL query that omits `AND session_id = ?` from the WHERE
clause would silently return sessionA's row when sessionB asks for the same
factId. CL-3 catches exactly that bug: seed under sessionA, read under sessionB
→ must be null. This invariant is load-bearing for SQLite correctness and
already covers the cross-session DB-sharing scenario without modification.

## CL-4 — NaN passthrough (trust corruption round-trip)

**Verdict: TIGHTENED. Comment strengthened; test title updated.**

**Finding:** CL-4 was silent on whether the harness `seed` function must write
to the backing store before `read` is called. The test name was `"returns
{trust: NaN} for a NaN-seeded fact — read layer does NOT validate"` — framed as
a validation policy test, not a persistence test. For the in-memory impl, seed
and read are both JS-heap operations and there is no serialization gap. For
SQLite, this is the critical failure mode: SQLite has no NaN literal and stores
`NULL` for NaN; `read` must re-hydrate `NULL → NaN`. A naive SQLite harness that
caches the seed value in memory (bypassing the INSERT) would pass the old CL-4
while allowing a real NULL-handling bug to ship silently.

**Before:**

```
// CL-4 — Trust passthrough: corrupt value (NaN)
//
// Seed a fact with trust=NaN → read must return {trust: NaN}.
// The read layer is NOT responsible for validating trust; that is the
// caller's job (applyFeedbackById throws InvalidTrustValueError(source:'storage')).
// Silently clamping or filtering at read time would hide storage corruption.

it('CL-4: returns {trust: NaN} for a NaN-seeded fact — read layer does NOT validate', ...)
```

**After:**

```
// CL-4 — Trust passthrough: corrupt value (NaN)
//
// Seed a fact with trust=NaN → read must return {trust: NaN}.
// The read layer is NOT responsible for validating trust; that is the
// caller's job (applyFeedbackById throws InvalidTrustValueError(source:'storage')).
// Silently clamping or filtering at read time would hide storage corruption.
//
// Storage round-trip requirement: the harness `seed` function MUST write
// NaN to the backing store before `read` is called — not cache it in memory.
// For SQLite implementations, NaN has no native literal and is stored as NULL;
// `read` must re-hydrate NULL → NaN. This test is the primary regression lock
// for that NaN→NULL→NaN conversion path. A seed implementation that bypasses
// the backing store (e.g., caches in-memory) would let a silent conversion
// bug slip through.

it('CL-4: NaN trust round-trips through the storage write/read cycle — read layer does NOT validate', ...)
```

The assertion (`expect(Number.isNaN(result!.trust)).toBe(true)`) is already
correct and catches both `null` and `0` returns. The change is to the comment
and test name, which are now explicit contracts on `seed` semantics. The deeper
NaN-through-disk regression lock lives in `DB-CL-1` (edges file).

---

## CL-5 — Result shape: numeric trust field

**Verdict: SURVIVES UNCHANGED.**

The test seeds `trust=0.75` and asserts `typeof result!.trust === 'number'`.
SQLite's `REAL` column comes back as a JS `number` via `better-sqlite3`. Note:
if CL-4's NULL→NaN path were broken (returning `null`), `typeof null` is
`'object'`, which would also fail CL-5 — but CL-4 fires first and is the
correct catch-point. No change needed to CL-5.

## Summary Table

| Invariant | SQLite verdict | Action |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| CL-1 | Survives unchanged | None |
| CL-2 | Survives unchanged | None |
| CL-3 | Survives unchanged (stronger validator) | None |
| CL-4 | **Tightened** | Comment + title updated to require seed→store before read |
| CL-5 | Survives unchanged | None |

**4 of 5 invariants survive audit unchanged. 1 tightened (CL-4).**

## Rejection Trigger

If Roger's `SqliteFactReader` ships with a `seed` function that caches NaN
in memory rather than writing NULL to the DB, CL-4 will pass (false green) but
DB-CL-1 will FAIL on the close/reopen cycle. That constitutes a contract
violation. Reviewer protocol: REJECT Roger's PR and route the fix to a
**different agent** (not Roger). Proposed: Crispin (owns the InMemory reference
impl and understands the passthrough contract).
